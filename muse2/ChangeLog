                 Edit with new automation tool in arranger, to create new points hold down ctrl.
           TODO: Easy selection of colors, create new points need improvement, and probably a

09.01.2011:
        - These changes marked as p4.0.14:
        - Applied aux send fix AudioTrack::writeProperties() by Remon. Thanks. (Tim)
        - Fixed very slow midi trackinfo property adjustments with mixer shown. In AudioMixerApp::songChanged(). (Tim)  
        * Feature!: Complete soloing system (after 4 years). Support chaining Midi Port/Audio Out -> Audio In. (Tim)
          Click on audio strip iR, or midi strip oR, or midi track info oR buttons to see new additions.
          Tested thoroughly, but of course this major change needs wider testing. 
          TODO TODO: Fix trackinfo width (a minor button placement gui issue).
        * Some tweaks for automation viewing, more to do. (rj)
04.01.2011:
        - Added saving and restoring of pianoroll trackinfo h-splitter state. (Tim)
        - Fixed multiple velocity controllers appearing on song reload. Tested OK. (Tim)
        - Fixed arranger trackinfo widgets sizing - were allowed to shrink vertically. (Tim)
          TODO: Fix trackinfo scrollbar not showing at right time.
        - Replace all QWidget::setShown() calls with setVisible(). (Tim)
          It's supposed to be a Qt3 function, but still supported.
        - Enabled displaying of audio automation on tracks (rj)
        - Added right-click on track ARM buttons, now enables/disables all tracks of it's kind (rj)
02.01.2011:
        - Fixed arranger focussing problems again. (Tim)
          Scratch setFocusProxy() fix of 31.12. Gave MusE a keyPress handler and pass it on to canvas.
        - Fixed transport +/- position snapping. Works globally now too. (Tim)
          Moves by, and snaps to, snap setting of either an editor, or globally to arranger by default. 
        - Added transport position "Shift + +/-" keys, for no snapping. (Tim)
        - Removed (hopefully) the last bits of Qt3support functions from .ui files. (Orcan)
        - fixed patch loading for deicsonze and reverted to it's standard colortheme (rj)
31.12.2010:
        - Possible fix for arranger focussing problems. (Tim)
          Added parent->setFocusProxy(canvas) just after canvas created.
          Also added to pianoroll.
        - Added shadow behind the wallpaper titles for easier read. (Orcan)
30.12.2010:
        - Suggestion by OOM team: Add default velocity controllers to pianoroll and drum edit. (Tim)
        *Feature: Appearance part color names now can now be edited. (Tim)
          TODO: Add per-song settings and add toolbar with some colour goodies.
        *Feature: Mixer label colours can now be edited in the appearance settings. (Tim)
          TODO: Remix track icons using use alpha channel and special routine to mix in 
           these settable colours.
        *Fixed: Appearance settings palette was broken. (Tim)
          Note: A few odd Qt styles are wacky (Motif, Windows). Your mileage may vary.
        - In ctrl canvas, draw the grid before anything else. (Orcan)
29.12.2010:
        - Fixed Bigtime display when using a style sheet for MusE. (Tim)
          Set window font using a style sheet. Bigtime used QFont::setPixelSize(). 
          Application style sheets (even a blank one) override with the fixed application 
          font size (evidenced by adjusting MusE config font#0, then bigtime font size changed). 
          TODO: Darn, the tooltips fonts are as big as the labels! Must fix.
        - Added 2 wallpapers from Geoff Beasly.
        - Fixed focus stealing of transport (rj)
28.12.2010:
        - Tweaked and added some delays during project load to counter threading
          issues during loading of projects (rj)
        - Commented out the comment placeholder text line in projectcreateimpl.cpp. It
          broke the compilation against Qt-4.7. (Orcan)
        - Fixed the shift modifier issue in renaming parts in the arranger. (Orcan)
        - Fixed the 'no selected track' trackinfo background MusE logo display. (Tim)
          It was a memory leak as well. Was a simple fix in Arranger::genTrackInfo().
27.12.2010:
        - Added a first try at project creation dialog, we'll see how much territory
          it covers, intentionally it's only used upon creation of a project, later 'Save As'
          operations use the old dialog so multiple .med files can be saved for the
          same project (rj)
        - deferred creating *.wav files until the global record button is clicked,
          if a project does not exist at that time, pop up the new project dialog (rj)
        - changed 'new' project from listing PROJECT_VIEW to GLOBAL_VIEW where the
          templates reside, an enhancement would be to list USER_VIEW if it's template
          dir exists (rj)
        - Added myself to the AUTHORS list. Oops. (Orcan)
        - Added a mimetype file for *.med, *.med.gz, *.med.bz2 and associated MusE with this
          mimetype (and also midi and xml mimetypes) in the .desktop file. (Orcan)
        - Got manpages from Debian by Daniel Kobras, and updated them for MusE2. (Orcan)
        - Remove rem'd preview code in filedialog.cpp. I reimplemented it in appearance.cpp. (Orcan)
        - Remove the environment variables info from the usage output. (Orcan)
        - midiedit links to ctrl. (Orcan)
        - Merged changes from ccherrett into pianroll (h-splittter). (Tim)
        - changed open dialog to view stored project directory for PROJECT_VIEW (rj)
        - Fixed midi track info size issues. (Tim)
26.12.2010:
        - Initial addition of midi track info to pianoroll. WORK IN PROGRESS. (Tim)
          TODO: Just to get off the hard drive. A few things still need to be linked up!
                And we really need icons to replace those 'T' 'C' 'S' 'X' buttons.
        - Fix minor issues that surfaced when I built an RPM for the alpha release (Orcan):
              o Added missing AudioVideo category to the .desktop file.
              o Fixed the executable name in the .desktop file.
              o Converted README.softsynth, synti/vam/README, README.de, SECURITY to UTF8.
              o Made the default MusE_DOC_DIR consistent with other default definitions.
              o Removed explicit rpath to ${QT_LIBRARY_DIR}. cmake should add it automatically
                if there's need.
              o Removed unnecessary linkage to libQtSvg.
              o utils are installed with executable permissons.
25.12.2010:
        - Added fancy background selection widget with live preview to Appearance Settings. (Orcan)
        - Applied Geoff King's second capitalization patch.
23.12.2010:
        - MidiTrackInfo is now self-contained. (Tim)
          Moved all of its members from Arranger into MidiTrackInfo. Removed trackinfo.cpp
23.12.2010:
        - MusE 2.0alpha released! (rj)
22.12.2010:
        - Capitalizations in the menus thanks to Geoff King (gsking1->gmail. com)
        - Added some comments in app.cpp that I've been willing to include for a while. (Orcan)
        - Added a line to CMakeLists to install the splash image. Commented out for now. (Orcan)
        - added new-user help dialog for Input button on midi track-info (rj)
        - Fixed *some* gui drawing speed issues. (Tim)
          Use Qt::WA_OpaquePaintEvent for windows we fully draw on, like part canvas, track list, meter.
          In PartCanvas::drawItem(), ignore null intersect of item bbox + rect.
          TODO: Other windows like Slider and Knob could probably use this. And with many parts,
                 drawing is still slow (esp waves), possibly because of alpha blending. 
21.12.2010:
        - Moved all the config files "~/.musePrj, ~/.MusE, ~/.deicsonze.dco" into ~/.config/MusE/
          and renamed them as "projects, MusE.cfg, deicsonze.dco", respectively. (Orcan)
        - User instruments path is made user configurable with default location in
          ~/.config/MusE/instruments
        - In simpledrums2, set the 64bit ladpsa plugin paths. (Orcan)

        - Fixed arranger grid h-line drawing, track, and part drawing alignment, border issues. (Tim)
        - To open help pages, use the default browser of the system via QDeskopServices. Removed
          the configuration option to select the browser. (Orcan)
        - Added some groupboxes and layouts to Global Settings to make it look more uniform. (Orcan)
        - Don't pack the binary and subversion directories when doing "make package_source". (Orcan)
        - Updated the Russian translation again thanks to Alex, alex54m -> mail.ru
        - Fix a typo in awl/CMakeLists.txt that disabled the translations for awl. (Orcan)
        - Updated all the .ts files with the latest strings. Made sure that share/locale/CMakeLists
          is scanned last so that all the translations are collected before coming to that. (Orcan)
        - Fix: cliplist target should depend on widgets target. (Orcan)
19.12.2010:
        - Fixed not saving part colours and part canvas background appearance settings. (Tim)
        *Feature: Added 'global opaqueness' (transparency) appearance setting. (Tim)
          Currently only affects part colours. 
          TODO: Fix the darn black rectangle drawing. Apply the opaqueness to some other things.
        - Fixed arranger part drawing borders. Used QPen::setCosmetic(true) when drawing. (Tim)

          Unified their notation. Added copyright notices to those which were missing. 
        - Defined MusE_SHARE_DIR and MusE_LIB_DIR in config.h.in so that these directories 
          can be accessed conveniently in the code. (Orcan)
        - Install documentation files to the standard docdir specified by FHS. (Orcan)
18.12.2010:
        - Fixed transport shortcuts not working in some windows or situations. (Tim)
          Added event->ignore to PartCanvas::keyPress. Added setFocusPolicy() to WaveView, Master.
          Added (canvas or view)->setFocus() to WaveEdit, MasterEdit. Test OK.
        - Fixed rack drag'n drop. Added individual tooltips for effects since the astrip might
          be too narrow. (Orcan)
17.12.2010:
        - Fixed crash with song loaded then File->New. Marker view had non-existent items from cleared marker list. (Tim)
        - Some memory leak cleanups. Delete midiInstruments and midiDevices. (Tim)
          TODO: Many more leaks to fix. 
16.12.2010:
        - Fixed track list track moving/resizing - added ev->buttons() check to mouseMoveEvent(). (Tim)
        - Fixed meter drawing (speed) - removed double buffer pixmap. Test OK. (Tim)
15.12.2010:
        - Major cleanup in the #includes. Emptied all.ha nnd moved its contents to individual files.
          The build is roughly 20% faster now. (Orcan)
        - Fixed track list drawing - removed double buffer pixmap. Test OK. (Tim)  
14.12.2010:
        - Fixed corruption on track info instrument patch button due to latin1() conversions. (Tim)
          Changed MidiInstrument::getPatchName() and EditInstrument::getPatchName() to return QString.
13.12.2010:
        - List the available locales in the --help output. (Orcan)
        - Fixed audio/midi control right-click automation popups were greyed out due to typo. (Tim)
        - Fixed some QMenu usages without parent and/or delete. (Tim)
        - DeicsOnze: Fixed: Crash in ctor, _preset not init. by time loadConfiguration called. Re-arranged. 
          And 3 popup QMenu usages without delete. Test OK. (Tim)
        - Deicsonze: Fixed all missing icons throughout. Added qrc file, changed ui file. Looks nice now. (Tim) 
12.12.2010:
        - Integrated the translation system into cmake. Added a -DUPDATE_TRANSLATIONS flag to cmake
          which will update the .ts files in the source tree with the newest strings. I used this to
          update the existing translations. Also I removed the .qm files from the SVN, as they will
          be now installed from the build tree. (Orcan)
        - Added a -l flag to the muse executable to override the locale detection, mostly for testing
          purposes. (Orcan)
        - Updated the Russian translation thanks to Alex, alex54m -> mail.ru
        - When updating the .ts files, by adding proper dependencies, make sure all targets are 
          scanned. Otherwise .ts files may miss some strings. (Orcan)
11.12.2010:
      * Feature: Added default midi track in/out channels to midi ports list. (Tim)
        - For now, the boxes use the old text channel strings ("1 3 5", "1-5", "all, "none" etc.)
      * Changed: Experimental: Mid ports now default to 'GM' instrument. (Tim)
        - Was stopping new users from seeing instrument patches etc.
        - TODO: Overhaul instrument type, instrument sysexes, and song type.
      * Changed: Audio groups and inputs no longer default connect to first audio out. (Tim)
        - Find it tedious, once a song grows with groups and inputs, to keep disconnecting them from output.
        - TODO: Add a better audio default routing system.
10.12.2010:
        - More compiler and build warnings fixes. (Orcan)

        - Fixed ctrl canvas not lining up in drumedit and pianoroll. (Orcan)
        - Fix: Save project file dialog should have a "Save" button instead of "Open". (Orcan)
        - Fix: Crash when Ok is clicked in the plugin selection dialog with no plugins
          selected. Well, I fixed the crash, then I also disabled the Ok button until
          a plugin is selected. (Orcan)
        - Feature: Middle mouse button click on a plugin in the rack will (un)byass the 
          plugin. (Orcan)
        - Actually, use Qt:MidButton instead of instead of Qt:MiddleButton in rack.cpp.
          The latter is Qt >= 4.7 only.
09.12.2010:
        - Fix: column orders mess up in the main window, and they do not save properly in
          the .med files. (Orcan)
        - Made MusE the owner of transport object so it's now deleted when MusE object is deleted. (Tim)
        - Improved PosEdit class, supports undo/redo levels, focus-out + return pressed updating. (Tim)
          This also fixes the Transport position boxes' sections jumping to last section. 
          TODO: There's still trouble editing with KB in Bar-Beat-Tick mode, the bar and beat being '1' based.
          TODO: Fix SigEdit (the time Signature Editor boxes).
        - Fix some build and compiler warnings. (Orcan)
        - Fix the max slider value in the transport. This was a typo I made during conversion. (Orcan)
08.12.2010:
        - Ported many more Qt3 methods to Qt4. (Orcan)
        - Turned off Qt3Support. Muse2 is now a pure Qt4 application. (Orcan)
07.12.2010:
        - Ported rack. TODO: Drag and drop needs a hand. It's not working. (Orcan)
        - Converted various Qt3 support methods to Qt4 in many files. (Orcan)
        - Includes cleanup in app.*. (Orcan)
        - Converted all instances of latin1() and crossed my fingers. Initial tests OK. (Orcan)
06.12.2010
        - Built Awl::posedit and Awl::sigedit, and replaced /widget versions and all usages. (Tim)
          TODO: Awl::sigedit has no returnPressed signal, for lmaster. 
          TODO: Transport position posedits jump to sub-ticks sections - can't auto-inc other sections.
        - Reverted class SpinBox to previous revision. Test OK. (Tim)
05.12.2010
        - Completed porting of dlist module (the drum list). Test OK. (Tim)
        - Ported sigedit and posedit. Used SpinBox in place of Q3SpinWidget. TODO: Needs some work on
          locating the arrows of the SpinBox accurately. Maybe we need to implement another SpinBox
          from scratch? (Orcan)
        - Ported plugin.cpp. Both internal and LADSPA plugins tested okay. (Orcan)
        - Trivial conversion of Qt3 support methods to Qt4 in some widgets: slider, sliderbase, knob,
          ttoolbutton, mlabel. (Orcan)
04.12.2010
        - Fix: Escape button does not exit track renaming editor. (Orcan)
        - Fix: Midi ports config table items are editable when they are not supposed to. (Orcan)
        - Ported scldiv. Things seem to work as before. Maybe needs more testing. (Orcan)
        - Removed fontsel, and synthwizardbase from the project. (Orcan)
        - Feature: In waveedit, the mousewheel controls the vertical slider. (Orcan)
        - Completed porting shortcutcapturedialog, filedialog. Added paste clone, 2track, clone2track, 
           insert empty, insert, to configurable shortcuts. Changed all arr/pianoroll/drumedit hard-wired 
           keys to refer to shortcut table. (TODO: Other windows?) (Tim)
        - Correction: Convert all state() to QInputEvent::modifiers() and stateAfter() to modifiers()
           (I forced a downcast to QInputEvent if required). Is correct? QT Help says:
           QInputEvent::modifiers() "Returns the keyb. mod. flags that existed imm. before the event occurred."
           QKeyEvent::modifiers()   "Returns the keyb. mod. flags that existed imm. after the event occurred."           
03.12.2010
        - Ported all copy/paste/drag/drop coding. Including pianoroll, drumedit, pcanvas, prcanvas, dcanvas, 
           and effect rack. Test OK cut, copy, paste, also drag n drop various files to arranger and rack. (Tim)
        - Fixed arranger menu cut/copy enabling. Was never right before. Test OK cut and copy. (Tim)
        - Completed port of MidiInstrument. Fixed its populatePatchPopup(), which fixes midi trackinfo 
           instrument selection not updating h-bank, l-bank, and prog spinboxes. (Tim)
        - Some cleanups: Remove the old Header class. Rename HeaderNew to Header. (Orcan)
        - Ported: osc, wave, dcanvas. (Orcan)
02.12.2010
        - Ported alayout, tlist, arranger (Orcan)
        - Minor tweak in the HeaderNew API to set column widths easier. Also commented out the
          old Header class. We can probably remove it soon. (Orcan)
        - Ported help.cpp as is. But maybe we should use QDesktopServices to open user's default browser
          instead of the browser specified in a config option. (Orcan)
        - Ported scrollscale and splitter (Orcan)
01.12.2010
        - Ported listedit. (Orcan)
        - I missed to port one action call in drumedit. Now it's (hopefully) done. (Orcan)
        - Ported midiport. This also finishes the port of dlist. (Orcan)
30.11.2010
        - Ported vscale and ctrledit. (Orcan)
29.11.2010
        - In Mess::processEvent(), added ME_PITCHBEND case. For synths which don't override 
           processEvent (like Vam and Deicsonze). Pitchbend should work in them now. (Tim)
        - Added a new HeaderNew (Qt4 based) class to be used instead of Header (Qt3 based). (Orcan)
        - Ported drumedit except a Q3PopupMenu reference that needs to be ported in midiport.cpp.
          This update restores the tooltips, adds icons to edit menu items in drumedit window. (Orcan)
28.11.2010
        - Finished porting Marker View. (Orcan)
        - Ported ctrlpanel. Needs some testing. I also removed usage of the Oxygen's "pen" icon
          in place of the pencil. The pen looks bad in ctrlpanel. (Orcan)
        - Deicsonze2 added (!!) Fresh re-import from evolution. Test OK. (Tim)
          TODO: Plugin controllers disabled - we need the Ctrl class. 
                Restoring of state (that's a MusE problem I think).   
                Fix deicsonze.cpp:3612: warning: deprecated conversion from string constant to ‘char*’
        - Ported Mastertrack list view. (Orcan)
        - Finished porting of Canvas module. Should be done. Not sure about one mouse event buttons() usage. (Tim)
27.11.2010
        - Completed porting pianoroll module including menus, shortcuts. Should be done. (Tim)
        - Ported the following .ui widgets to Qt4: organguibase, gatetime, midisync,
          routedialogbase, vamguibase, 1050, 2142. (Orcan)
        - Fixed the whatsthis and tooltip bits of tho Midi Ports dialog. (Orcan)
        - Ported Quant Config dialog. (Orcan)
        - Ported the popup menus in the canvas. This should restore the color selection of tracks. (Orcan)
        - Removed midiportroutebase.ui, fdialogbase.ui (the one from organ) (Orcan)
        - Removed some unnecessary Q3* references. Converted popup menus in various places. (Orcan)
26.11.2010
        - Fixed midi trackinfo growing size - set output device list box and instrument button 
           h-size policy to 'Ignore'. (Tim)
        - Fixed trackinfo spinboxes only go to 99 - changed some trackinfo ui spinbox properties
           (maxValue -> maximum, minValue -> minimum etc). (Tim)
        - Fixed SpinBoxFP class. Was never right before. (Tim)
        - Fixed transform and input transform ui files and dialogs - using the corrected SpinBoxFP. (Tim)   
        - Converted comboQuant widget to Qt4 (found in miditransform dialog). 
          TODO: Doesn't actually open - why? (Tim)
        - Finished porting edit instrument dialog to Qt4. listitem.h is removed as it is no longer
          needed. (Orcan)
        - Added missing includes on comboQuant. The compilation was failing here. (Orcan)
25.11.2010
        - Fixed column widths, alignments, device renaming and jack device creation issues in synthconfigbase.
          Somehow the last changelog entry about this didn't get committed. That's added too. (Orcan)
24.11.2010
        - Resinstated the Midi Transformer. Was left out when both TF and iTF were removed, and then I 
           asked for them to be put back. So yes, transformbase.ui is used now. (Tim)
        - Completed conversion of waveedit(.cpp, h), including menus and shortcuts. Should be done. (Tim)
        - Set undo/redo shortcuts on global undoAction/redoAction, instead of Q3Accel in each window. (Tim)
        - Fixed some leftover setAccel()'s in app.cpp (Tim) 
        - Fixed delete shortcut key. Set in MusE constructor. (Tim)
        - Reinstated special Toplevel::CLIPLIST case in MusE::toplevelDeleted(). Caused problems. (Tim)
          TODO: Still not right with the menu checkmark...
        - Ported rhythmbase, fluidsynthgui, fluidgui to Qt4 (Orcan)
        - Removed patchbaybase from the project (Orcan)
        - Added ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL flag to cmake. Marked rhythmbase, s1 experimental (Orcan)
        - Fixed a connection in miditransform (Orcan)
        - Fixed crash in FluidSynthGui::channelItemClicked(): Use item->row() for the channel. Test OK. (Tim)
        - Start porting synthconfigbase. It's mostly functional. TODO: Column widths and alignments,
          renaming device name, port Q3WhatsThis bits (Orcan)
23.11.2010
        - Added Track::cname(), applied to strip labels' object names, so they may be used in style sheets. (Tim)
        - Added struct SysEx and some friends, to minstrument.h, prep. for the instrument editor. (Tim)
22.11.2010
        - Oops, fixed regression, marker view and cliplist crashes, removed setAttribute(Qt::WA_DeleteOnClose) 
           from TopWin constructor, and added it to individual TopWin sub-classes (only MidiEditor needs it). (Tim)
        - Final major leak fixed: We can now delete the main MusE object just before returning from main! (Tim)
          Now that markerview, cliplist et. al. are also being deleted (verified, dtors called), I changed 
           MusE::startClipList() so the main MusE instance owns it like all the others. It deletes too, now. 
          Also removed odd special Toplevel::CLIPLIST case in MusE::toplevelDeleted(). Hope it works... 
          Tested closing complex song, with all windows open. Nice to see final Finished! message (new, with -D).
        - Eliminated double-buffer pixmap in View class (not required in Qt4). TODO: install event handler. (Tim) 
        - Ported the following .ui widgets to Qt4: editgainbase, gensetbase (Orcan)
        - Removed unused .ui widgets: wtrackinfo.ui, editctrl7dialogbase.ui, editmetadialogbase.ui (Orcan)
        - Fixed remaining alignment issues in editors, using setSpacing(0). TODO Controller panels. (Tim) 
21.11.2010
        - All menus now use QActions. Some shortcuts are left to be assigned correctly (Orcan)
        - Clean up: Remove submenu integer ids from the MusE class in favor of QActions (Orcan)
        - Ported the following .ui widgets to Qt4: didyouknow, transposebase, cliplist,
          configmidifilebase (Orcan)
        - Ported View and MidiEditor classes. Fixed TopWin constructor. Test OK all editors. (Tim) 
20.11.2010
        - Remove most wrapper classes around .ui widgets. I was wrapping them too much. Some widgets
          (e.g. songinfo) still need wrappers though. (Orcan)
        - Ported the following .ui widgets to Qt4: appearancebase, mixdowndialogbase, 
          shortcutcapturedialogbase, shortcutconfigbase, aboutbox, editsysexdialogbase,
          editnotedialogbase, editctrlbase (Orcan)
        - Converted all of editevent.cpp to Qt4 (Orcan)
        - Load default compiled-in style-sheet resource :/style.qss in main(). (Tim)
          Added style sheet support to Appearance settings, with reset button.
19.11.2010
        - Started some conversions of midieditor, pianoroll, drumedit, incl. their QGridLayouts. (Tim)
        - More icon conversion work (Orcan)
        - Move global, user, project .xpm files into the xpm/ directory. Handle them the same way in 
          filedialog.cpp as we handle other pixmaps elsewhere. (Orcan)
        - Ported the following .ui widgets to Qt4: commentbase, metronomebase, mtrackinfobase, 
          midifilter (Orcan)
18.11.2010
        - Updated build part README file - read it! Tell user to specify Release build type. (Tim)
        - Added printout of build type in top level cmake. (Tim)
        - Removed duplicate LASH detection in top level cmake. (Tim)
        - Ported the following .ui widgets to Qt4: transformbase, itransformbase, mrconfigbase (Orcan)
        - Finished remaining port work of mixer and strips. Should be all done now. (Tim)
	- Modified icons.cpp to Use theme icons whenever possible. We now need to match muse
	  icons with the standard theme icon names (Orcan)
17.11.2010
        - Removed a fix which cured graphic corruption for me in MusE-1. Not required now. (Tim)
        - Small change to Orcan's filedialog, re-enabled global button. (Tim)
        - Ported the following .ui widgets to Qt4: songinfo, mittransposebase, velocitybase (Orcan)
16.11.2010
        - Fixed track info sizing problems. In Arranger::switchInfo() added tgrid->update(). (Tim)
          QLayout::update() seems to be a new method, we needed to call it here.
        - Fixed mixer maximum and minimum sizes. (Tim)
          Bit of a tough hack. Is there a better way? Done by sub-classing QScrollArea and catching 
           LayoutRequest events, just before paint events when the window sizes are finally correct.
          TODO: Still off by a few pixels when mixer first opened, because main window frameSize 
           is not set yet, by the time LayoutRequest is caught.
	- Transformed file dialogs to Qt4. This was the first attempt to transform a .ui file to Qt4
	  as well. New .ui files do not store image information. Thus I moved the 3 icons from
	  qfiledialog.ui into their own files.
	  TODO: Qt4 does not support file preview in file dialogs yet. The relevant code (wallpaper
	  preview) is disabled. Now we either have to implement an image previewer, or forget about
	  this feature. (Orcan)
	- Only try to use theme icons in file dialogs if Qt >= 4.6 (Orcan)
14.11.2010
        - renamed deicsonze2 files and classes with '2' suffixes
        - Applied patch by Orcan to convert populateAddSynth(). (Tim)
        - Changed all setMargin() calls to setContentsMargins(). (setMargin() is obsoleted!) (Tim)
        - Fixed crash in MusE::closeEvent() upon close: save, skip, abort? = abort. (Tim)
          TODO: Some other suspicious looking closeEvent()s. May need to fix...
12.11.2010
        - Fixed arranger alignment issues - set layout margins to zero. (Tim)
          TODO: Track list items aligned to canvas tracks are still off by one lousy vertical pixel.
11.11.2010
        - WIP: Mixer and strips re-designed to be theme/font friendly - no more fixed STRIP_WIDTH. (Tim)
        - Fixed Slider, Knob and DoubleEntry classes. Knob anti-aliasing applied (where allowed).
        - Transport handle colour fixed - added setAutoFillBackground(true). 
10.11.2010
        - Ported transport window to Qt4. The handle color needs a fix (Orcan) 
09.11.2010
        - Fixed audio and midi strips and converted to Qt4. Looks OK now, but will be better... (Tim)
          TODO: Convert Slider, Knob, EffectRack, ComboBox classes etc. (After that the strips will be perfect.)
08.11.2010
	- Add missing link to libdl.so. Caused bulid failure on Fedora 14 (Orcan)
        - Fixed strip name label colours, also name label auto-font-sizing. (Tim) 
        - Updated some window flags (stay on top, delete on close...) (Tim)
07.11.2010
        - Mixer is fixed and converted to QT4. (Tim)
        - Conversion of TLLayout class to QT4. 
        - Conversion of TempoEdit class to QT4. Displays proper doubles now.
06.11.2010
        - Yipee! De retour aux les popup menus 'stay-open'. (Tim)
        - Fixed PopupMenu class. All routing popups done (midi trackinfo, midi strip, audio strip).
          TODO: Fix midi 'toggle all'. Use routes as QVariant action user data (someone started this already)...
        - Major cleanup of audio and midi strip comments, code. (A fresh start for your tired eyes, you guys...)
        - Test OK so far with all track types. 
04.11.2010
        - Fixed LADSPA plugin dialog. TODO: fix sorting order. (Tim)
        - Fixed MenuTitleItem class. Fixed some usages of it (Jack popup routes, midi cfg routes). (Tim) 
02.11.2010
        - Solved! All the MESS synths load now. Removed mpevent(.h, .cpp) and evdata.h from /libsynti, 
           conflicting with copies in /muse, causing crashes. Versions in /muse are newer. 
          Should only be one version. Whether we end up putting it in a library, or leaving it 
           in the main app as I have done here, it had to be moved one way or another. 
          If we really need 'reduced, simplified' functionality of the /libsynti mpevent versions,
           then it should be a base/inherited class type of solution, not two different copies. (Tim)
02.11.2010
        - Fluid, fluidsynth, simpledrums: Testing: For now, disable certain sendSysex() calls crashing. (Tim)
          Marked as "MusE FIXME:". At least fluidsynth appears to be working now. Other two not so good.
01.11.2010
        - Fixed all MESS plugins: compile with -fvisibility=hidden, to avoid namespace conflicts.
          In particular, simplesynth was causing conflict with variable 'plugins' causing it to 
           be overwritten. 
        - So, this fixes LADSPA plugins not appearing in plugin list.
        - Added simpledrums from muse_qt4_evolution, is called 'simpledrums2' and replaces the original.
31.10.2010
        - Fixed Toolbar1 class. 'Snap', 'Quantize' combo boxes should work now. Thanks to Luis G. for help. (Tim)
30.10.2010
        - Fixed Deicsonze crash and missing Organ. Both load now. (Tim.)
27.10.2010
        - Fixed drawing of Slider widget and Meter widget (rj)
        - Fixed keyboard shortcuts for tools on toolbar (rj)
        - More conversions with windows done previously done, fixes. Marker, Master gui + List. (Tim)
          Some new style header fixes here/there. 
26.10.2010  
        - Fixed non-opening view menu windows (mixers, marker, bigtime etc). (Tim)
          Found all the isItemChecked() returning opposite of before (for example in toggleBigTime()). 
          And yet the setItemChecked() remains unmodified and it works (for example in showBigtime()).
          Not understood why - yet.
26.10.2010  
        - Applied large patch by Orcan to (start) converting to native QMainWindow and QToolBar. (Tim)
        - Completed piano roll, drum edit, MusE app, and arranger toolbars.
24.10.2010  
        - Finds MESS synths now including fluid/fluidsynth, but all crash except Vam and S1. (Tim.)
22.10.2010  
        - cmake scripts changes thanks to Orcan Ogetbil oget.fedora > gmail.com (Tim.)
          'make uninstall' facility added! 
          Drop our obsolete pkgconfig for newer native cmake pkgconfig.
          LASH detection fixed.
          Summary added.
          Renamed installed executable 'muse' to 'muse2'.
          Install /utils, /packaging, and /demos files.
          Other minor changes.
21.10.2010  
        - Toolbar1 usage of Q3ListBox changed to QTableWidget. (p4.0.3 Tim)
        - More Toolbar1 fixes. (p4.0.4 Tim)
        - Fixed widgets/tools.cpp EditToolBar::EditToolBar connect Q3Action. (p4.0.5 Tim)
        - Crashes: Removed all "undoRedo->removeFrom..." from destructors (~pianoroll() ~drumedit() etc.) (p4.0.6 Tim)
20.10.2010
      * Fixed: cmake should work now. (T356)
        - Changed the QT4_WRAP_UI3 macro to generate  <filename>.h  instead of  ui_<filename>.h
        - In /muse/CMakeLists.txt, included all the uic generated headers paths (the 'build' paths). 
        - Tested OK with fresh svn pull.
19.10.2010
      * Fixed: Some missing files, errors with cmake build. (T356)
19.10.2010
      * Changed: Build system changed to cmake. (T356)
        - Some other suitable changes. p4.0.2
        - WIP Need to fix a few placed in code with regards to installation search paths (MESS synths not found etc.)
        - Choose suitable version number. Currently left at 2.0.1 
        - Maybe a few other things. Change name of prog so as not to conflict with existing muse installation? etc. etc.
        - Default install location is /usr/local. Be careful not to overwrite an existing working muse-1 !
16.10.2010
      * Fixed: Routing and popup menus should work now. Sorry, no 'stay-open' menus for now. (T356)
        - p4.0.1 Reverted back to regular non-overloaded Q3PopupMenu behaviour (self-extinguishing) for PopupMenu class.
        - Removed "gRoutingMenuMap.clear()" and "gRoutingPopupMenuMaster = 0" from MusE::routingPopupMenuAboutToHide().
          Instead, added protection from non-visible menu in MusE::updateRouteMenus().
      * Tested: Pianoroll, drums open but toolbars are very messed up. Marker, transport, bigtime, all others seem OK.    
15.10.2010
      * Feature: Unified Jack midi devices in midi ports list. Can be both input and output, just like ALSA devices. (T356)
        - Marked as p3.3.55 
      * Corrected: Three things which did not compile in conversion to new muse-2: (T356) 
        - <string>true</string> -> <bool>true</bool> in mtrackinfobase.ui, for recEchoButton toggleButton property. (T356)
        - Surround with QString(): "strerror(errno)" in MusE::save(), and "incstr" in MidiDeviceList::add(). (T356)
14.10.2010
      =======================================
      * muse2 branch (Conversion to QT4, QT3 compatibility mode for now) checked in (rj) (T356)
      =======================================

09.10.2010
      * Fixed: Gluing of midi track parts, over tempo changes, caused incorrect note times and lengths. (T356)
        - Fixed Song::cmdGluePart().
08.10.2010
      * Disabled: Precount does not work, disabled function in gui (rj)
      =======================================
      * 1.1 tagged (rj)
      =======================================
      * added: missing headerfile in dssihost.cpp, required for building on Ubuntu Maverick (rj)
21.09.2010
      * Fixed: Mixers not restoring their size properly upon song load. (T356)
        - Rearranged MusE::loadProjectFile1() slightly so mixer resizing done at end. Tested OK.
      * Changed: Disabled some optimized code always enabled in Dsp::cpy(), for now, in case of 64-bit issues. (T356) 
16.09.2010
      * Created rc2 release for 1.1 (rj)
      * Fixed: Delete track(s) not disconnecting track routes, causing routes to hang around and store in song file. (T356)
        - Fixed major regressions (my fault) in Song::insertTrack2() and ::removeTrack2().
      * Fixed: Dummy audio device: Crashes when Jack midi device created in device manager, or loaded from song. (T356)
        - This allows to create Jack midi devices even when dummy audio driver is used.
        - Tested OK loading complex Jack midi based songs with dummy audio driver.
      * Fixed: AlsaTimer cannot start, with dummy audio device. (T356) 
        - Reverted: Back to default SND_TIMER_GLOBAL_SYSTEM in AlsaTimer, for now until a better fix. 
        - Also replaced pop-up warning in dummy loop with terminal output instead.
      * Changed: MidiDevice <-> Track routes replaced with MidiPort <-> Track routes. (T356)
        - This allows to change a port's device (even to <none> !) while keeping all the track channel routes.
      * Changed: Single midi <-> track route with channel mask, instead of one route-per-channel. (T356)
        - Potentially saving very many routes from memory and in song file.
10.09.2010
      * Fixed: regression with oR routing for Aux strips (rj)
05.09.2010
      * Fixed: shortcut for insert moved to Ctrl+Shift+X (rj)
      * Added: Select all toggle for midi channels iR menu (rj)
      * Added: Auto-route-connect old songs with obsolete midi input port/channel masks (before iR button added). (T356) 
        - Added MidiTrack::setInPortAndChannelMask() and called it from MidiTrack::read().
03.09.2010
      * Changed: Updated German localizations muse_de.qm and muse_de.ts from <babarosa [at] gmx.at> (T356)
      * Added: Instrument definitions and drum maps for Kurzweil SP2X, from <babarosa [at] gmx.at> (T356)
28.08.2010

      * Added: Instrument definitions for AKAI SG01 and Waldorf-microQ from <babarosa [at] gmx.at> (rj)
23.08.2010
      * Added: Possibility to turn on/off move-armed-track with track selection in settings (rj)
21.08.2010
      * Renamed: Soft synth configuration changed to Synth configuration, as per patch from Geoff King (rj)
      * Fixed: Shortcuts with modifier keys wasn't working for global shortcuts, should be now (rj)
      * Added: Shortcuts for changing len of events, default Ctrl+Shift+Left/Right (rj)
>>>>>>> .r459
10.08.2010
      * Fixed/Changed: Grid reacts to midi resolution change (rj)
01.08.2010
      * Added: Move track selection when part selection is moved, is this a good approach? (rj)
      * Added: Backspace unarms all armed tracks (rj)
24.07.2010
      * Feature: Audio and midi routing popup menus now stay open, for making rapid connections. (T356)
      * Fixed: Delete some objects hanging around upon close like song, audio, midiSeq, and prefetch. (T356)
               TODO: Find a way to delete the 'muse' object without causing problems like seg faults.
21.07.2010
      * Improved: Note lanes in pianoroll and marking of C-notes (rj)
20.07.2010
      * Fixed: illegal shortcut no longer reported on startup (rj)
18.07.2010
      * Fixed: Handle errors during timer initialization more gracefully (rj)
15.07.2010
      * Added: Volume control for audio metronome (rj)
12.07.2010
      * Fixed: When wave files were edited allocation was on stack which caused crashes for larger selections, now done on heap (rj)
      * Added: Print svn version in -v and About box. (rj)
      * Fixed: Bug with RemoveShortEvents plugin script, would not remove anything due to index error (rj)
10.07.2010
      * Added: Insert measure, inserts empty space and moves everything after playpointer to the right and
               Part-insert, pastes parts and moves everything after the paste point to the right
               it's currently not possible to change the shortcuts for these, wip (rj)
06.07.2010
      * Added: Button in transport to enable/disable jack transport. (rj)
      * Fixed: Dropdown Snap and Type in arranger toolbar no longer steal focus, annoyed the helloutame (rj)
      * Fixed: Making edits to larger chunks in wave files no longer cause a crash, heap is used for allocation (rj)
      * Improved: Part selection when navigating with keyboard, previously there was sometimes a need to use the mouse
        to get a part selected, now the first one should be selected (rj)
      * Added: some automation (very)wip stuff, not enabled, just to get it off my harddrive (rj)
22.06.2010
      * Fixed: Crashes loading a song while another is loaded. Or worse, it loads but saving corrupts the file! (T356)
        - Song::clear(): Clear all midi port devices. Delete Jack midi devices, and remove all ALSA midi device routes.
        - Route::read() Ignore bogus midi routes in med file if the device they refer to is not in use by the song (port is -1).
        - MidiJackDevice::writeRouting(), MidiAlsaDevice::writeRouting(): Ignore and do not write midi routes if the device 
           they refer to is not in use by the song (port is -1). This prevents bogus midi routes writing to med file.
        - Fifo::~Fifo(): Free the buffers! Fifo::getWriteBuffer(), Fifo::put(): Verify allocation. Fifo::get(): Verify buffers.
15.06.2010
      * Fixed: Jack midi output: Sent pitch bend and program values were incorrect, if coming from midi keyboard. (T356)
        - Reported by Pieter while using Hurdy Gurdy vst under fst. Tests OK now, here.
      * Fixed: Drum editor: Controller graph not in current tool mode (pencil, eraser etc.), when first opened. (T356)
        - Call setTool() in DrumEdit::addCtrl().
      * Fixing: Drum editor: Velocity controller graph showing incorrect for selected drum, or showing for all drums, when first opened. (T356) 
        - WIP. Still not quite correct, but at least now it doesn't show all drum velocities when first opened. 
          (This is interesting! I will try to allow 'no drum' list selection, to show all drum velocities at once, just like piano roll.)
13.06.2010
      * Fixed: More fixes to marker list, selected item was still not right. (T356)
03.06.2010
      * Fixed: Time signature editing problems in master track list and gui. (T356)
        - Fixed SigEdit::outOfRange(). Added Sig::isValid(), and check it in LMaster::returnPressed() to fix crash with 0 n or z.
      * Fixed: Marker/list problems. Double entries. Pianoroll/arranger timescale 'shift-left/right-click-to-add/del-marker' fixed. 
               Marker 'lock' (smpte/ticks) works now. Up/down buttons fixed. Marker list selection 'stays put' now 
                when adding or deleting markers. (T356)
      * Fixed: Graphics corruption in arranger and track list when vertically scrolling. (T356)
        - Changed rectangle to full w/h in 'shift down' section of View::setYPos() and TList::setYPos().
          Should not have to do this, but it cured my problems. No noticable change in speed.
        - Arranger corruption occured on more than one machine with xorg nv, ati drivers. More severe arranger AND track list 
           corruption occured with proprietary drivers. Corruption is also observed in several other windows (ex. ladspa browser) 
           but there's not much I can do, the corruption is found in ordinary usage of QListView for example.
      * Changed: Increased arranger vertical scroll step, was too slow to scroll. (T356)
      * Possible fix: Auto-scroll in pianoroll and arranger take waaay too long to stop scrolling. (T356)
        - Increased timer timeout from 40 to 80 ms in Canvas::scrollTimerDone(). Helped for me, on a 1.6Ghz P4...
      * Changed: Ladspa plugin guis now have scroll bars. Helps when there are many controls. (T356)
        - Still toying with the code a bit, please bear with me while I try to get it right.
      * Started: Addition of MusE-native ladspa guis for dssi synths. (T356)
        - No visible changes yet, just under the hood. Added class PluginIBase which is inherited by
           DssiSynthIF and PluginI. Changed class PluginGui and DssiSynthIF to fit. 
07.05.2010
      * Fixed: Xml file trouble: Tag attributes not storing xml-friendly entities, trouble reloading song. (T356)
        - Fixed all usages of Xml::nput, ::put, ::tag, and ::etag. Discovered by Geoff B.
06.05.2010
      * Fixed: Audio Input tracks: Loud noises or DC output with unconnected input routes. (T356)
        - AudioInput::getData(): Do not get buffers of unconnected client ports. Causes repeating leftover data.
      * Fixed: Audio Input tracks: Stereo processing not correct if both input routes connected to same port. (T356)
        - AudioInput::getData(): Just copy the buffers always, don't set buffer pointer directly.
      * Fixed: Effect rack plugins: Not saving correct number of plugin channels. Upon reload, channels are wrong. (T356)
        - PluginI::writeConfiguration() and PluginI::readConfiguration(): Write and read the channels, not instances.
        - Optimize TODO: Is xml plugin 'channel' really necessary? Well not now, but later if we optimize the effect rack
           by not creating redundant plugin instances if the next plugin in the rack doesn't need them.
          What I have changed is always make the number of plugin channels equal to the number of track channels.  
          PluginI::setChannels() and PluginI::initPluginInstance() then sort out the details of how many instances to create.
      * Fixed: Effect rack plugins: Some plugins crash MusE, for example plugins with no audio outputs. (T356)
        - PluginI::setChannels() and PluginI::initPluginInstance(): Be more aware of different audio ins and outs. 
      * Added: First draft help file README.effects-rack titled "Understanding the Effects Rack". (T356)
        - Details how MusE uses plugins, especially now with these changes.
27.04.2010
      * Changed: Building: Separate --enable-dssi --enable-osc configure options. (T356) 
        --enable-dssi (Enable dssi synths AND special handling of dssi-vst ladspa effect plugins. No guis if by itself.) and 
        --enable-osc (Enable dssi guis. Useless by itself at the moment). 
        Use both for best features. 
      * Feature: If dssi and osc support are enabled, audio track effects rack dssi-vst plugins can now show their NATIVE guis. (T356)
      * Fixed: Storing dssi synth states. Remembers current program, all configure strings, and control settings - for current program ONLY. (T356)
        - With dssi-vst synths, some better are than others at remembering program.
        - Todo: Ignore unwanted dssi-vst config strings/values like "guiVisible" "<name-of-fifo-file>" (gives non-fatal error on reload).
      * Fixed: Dssi native synths (hexter, LTS etc.) should actually work now. Their gui controls operate the sounds now. (T356) 
        - Todo: If using large audio buffers (Jack), my 'one-at-a-time-per-audio-process' osc control fifo streams kinda suck, 
           with a delay in their processing. Want to try MULTIPLE 'run's or 'run-multiple's PER audio process, for SAMPLE accuracy and
           better quicker message processing. Just need to add a timestamp to my osc fifo items, then all forms of change - whether
           control, midi event, or program - have a timestamp with which we can SPLIT UP the runs into 'runs between changes'.
      * Tip: Currently a patch to dssi-vst is required for their guis to update properly. (For now, ask about this on our lists.)
21.04.2010
      * Fixed: Shortcut for moving between tracks in arranger. Ctrl+Up/Down (rj)
19.04.2010
      * Patch: Fix for libdir bug causing synths to not be available on some 64bit systems. By Orcan Ogetbil (rj)
      * Fixed: Drawing of grid when snaping to less than measure (rj)
12.04.2010
      * Fixed: LADSPA rack effects: Do not display LADSPA output controls (such as latency). (T356)
      * Fixed: Bug when cancelling 'save as' operation, says 'file exists'. Caused by my earlier compressed save fixes. (T356)
11.04.2010
      * Fixed: DSSI requested midi mapped controls were not correct. (T356)
      * Changed: Working on controllers, and saving their state. Synths like Organ should remember their state now. (T356)
        - Working on DSSI controls... Working on OSC stuff...
06.04.2010
      * Fixed: Jack midi, and DSSI: Midi controller knobs, sliders, boxes etc. not updating with current values. (T356)
        - Copied code in MidiPort::sendEvent() to JackMidi::processMidi() and DssiSynthIF::getData().
      * Fixed: DSSI: Crashing with unkown controllers sent to synths. (T356)
        - Ignore unkown controllers in DssiSynthIF::processEvent(). 
05.04.2010
      * Added: Rec enabled track moved with selection when only one track is rec enabled (rj)
      * Changed: Made canvas show grid the default (rj)
      * Added: Jack midi ports can now be renamed in the ports list dialog, by clicking on the name. (T356)
        - Also cleaned up ports list behaviour and added tooltips.
30.03.2010
      * Major reworks: Jack midi, routing system, multichannel synth ins/outs, midi strips and trackinfo pane. (T356)
        - WORK IN PROGRESS. Should be usable for current projects.
        - ADVISORY: If opening current projects you are advised to "save as" or back up your med files (waves should be OK)
           until all is deemed to be working OK. It is possible more changes to .med file structure are needed later.
        - Some .med project file structures have CHANGED (like routing). I have tested opening large existing projects, 
           then re-saving them. OK so far.
          However, I have not added importing code for the old midi trackinfo panel 'input port' and 'input channel' boxes (gone now).
          If you want to wait, I am planning to do that, but later... Otherwise you must re-enter them with the new midi input routing.
        - ** Multichannel synth inputs and outputs: Fairly satisfied with popup menus, hopefully no major reworks... 
          Routing system fully supports multichannel synth mono/stero paths but is NOT COMPLETE yet. 
          When changing a connected track from stereo to mono, there is no coding yet to ensure the existing stereo routes are 
           changed from stereo to mono (just like the audio input and output tracks have always done with Jack routes).
          Also coding must be added to avoid simultaneous mono and stereo routes - make them mutually exclusive - although
           there's nothing technically wrong with it, it's just not desirable. 
        - ** Jack midi: You now create your own Jack midi ports. I have not added any means to delete them yet, but I believe
           if you 'unselect' them in the midi ports list so that they are not used, then the saved .med file will ignore them.
        - Multi-instances of MusE should work OK now - all ports should hopefully have unique names.    
        - Number of midi ports increased from 32 to 128. It's a bit much for the ports list, was planning "create your own
           midi port as needed" (like RG). Obstacles seem to have been cleared now, but it would be a big job (lots of places to change).
        - Along the way various tweaks and fixes when I spotted them.
18.02.2010
      * Added: Separate Jack midi client ports per MusE port. (T356)
        - For now, you will have to manually add further connections to those ports if desired, each session.
        - Tested OK rec/play so far.
      * Fixed: Some inconsistencies in midi controller number decoding. (T356)
        - Everything now references the values listed in midictrl.h
      * Fixed: Some Jack code was not calling free after calling certain functions. (T356)
      * Changed: Midi priority now deaults to audio priority +1. (T356)
        - Thanks to RJ for the convincing argument.
14.02.2010
      * Added: Jack midi input should be working now. Controllers, too. (T356)
        - Tested with large 1024 frame buffer. Events are recorded with good sub-tick (frame) resolution,
           as viewed in pianoroll with 64T snap grid. 
13.02.2010
      * Fixed: Jack midi output should now be frame-accurate, support variable length events (like sysex), 
                and most controllers should work. (T356)
        - TODO: No record yet. Just playback. 
        - TODO: I have code in place for multiple device listing (like ALSA) with auto-connect, 
           instead of single 'jackmidi' device, but it doesn't seem to want to actually connect. 
          Simply enable the #define JACK_MIDI_SHOW_MULTIPLE_DEVICES in driver/jackmidi.h 
           and it will magically switch. Shows port names as their alias #1 (with a rem'able line to 
           revert to non-alias names - to be made configurable later). I swear it was working, 
           then intermittent, then not at all. Hmm...
06.02.2010
      * Fixed: MusE hanging on close, with Jack driver. (T356)
        - Unregister Jack midi ports on destruction of JackAudioDevice.
05.02.2010
      * Fixed: Top level windows: Do not open if there are no parts. Case: bogus -1 top-level part index stored in med file. (T356)
        - Changed MusE::readToplevels() and stuff in listedit.cpp
        - Was causing crash of list editor upon loading a song saved with the list editor open. 
          Somehow a bogus -1 top-level part index can make it in to the .med file. Checking this...
      * Changed: Preparations for audio processors: Moved stuff out of class Event and into class WavePart. (T356)
        - WavePart needs a converter map to lookup events in the part's (shared) event list, in case clones exist !
          Ughh, it's going to be tough to ensure the map is always correct because an event cannot tell what part owns it...
04.02.2010
      * Improved: Grid handling in arranger improved, it should now be actually usable (rj)
01.02.2010
      * Fixed: Jack midi output: Stuck or missing notes. (T356)
        - Must only be one jack_midi_event_reserve() per event in handle_jack_midi_out_events().
31.01.2010
      * Changed: Midi sync window: Clock is now seperated from other real time commands (play/stop etc). (T356)
31.01.2010
      * Fixed: Midi sync in: Should be very solid and 'in time' now, play/stop/continue. (T356)
        - Re-coded to begin incrementing immediately upon first-clock detection. Forbid MusE to send transport commands 
           while in external sync mode - our sync router handles that. Was causing problems. 
        - Tested OK: Ensoniq ESQ-1 KB (sends clocks ony between start and stop) and Roland TR-505 drums (clocks always running). 
          The measured general timings were quite different, but (thankfully) clocks and events were not. 
        - MusE responds better to the TR-505 than the ESQ-1 does with a direct midi cable connection! (ESQ gains ticks on continue).
      * Added: Midi sync window: 'Rewind on start' column. (Also a 'Send first clock delay' box - not implemented yet). (T356)
29.01.2010
      * Feature: Dummy audio driver: Added global settings for sample rate and period size. (T356)
        - The period size affects midi resolution, and the default was just too long. So this was added.
27.01.2010
      * Changed: Don't process audio prefetch, or getData() in Audio::copyData(), if track is 'Off'. (T356)
      * Added: Arranger track list: Quick 'right-click' or 'ctrl-click' or 'ctrl-mouse-wheel' toggling of Track On/Off. (T356) 
        - Note this includes midi tracks now! Remains to be seen whether allowing midi off is useful and will work, 
           or should be filtered out. **TODO: Turn off remaining controls in midi strips, turn off actual midi playback and record.
      * Feature: Initial Jack midi support. Imported from Larry Valkama's GIT repo. (T356)
26.01.2010
      * Fixed: Import midi 'replace' broken last fixes. (T356)
      * Fixed: External midi sync: Wait until first clock after start to start transport, and >= second clock to increment ticks. (T356)
24.01.2010
      * Added: Midi sync: Added 'Jack timebase master' checkbox, removed requirement of MusE being tempo map master. (T356)
      * Added: While on external sync and Jack timebase master, reports correct MusE BBT info to Jack. (Tempo not correct yet). (T356)
      * Added: Midi import option: Whether to split imported tracks into multiple parts. (T356)
23.01.2010
      * Fixed: External midi sync in: MusE transport not rewinding upon reception of start. (T356)
      * Added: Midi sync: MusE now transmits and receives some MMC commands, and displays some MTC and SMTPE info. (T356)
        - No transmit MTC or receive MTC syncing yet, just transport control stuff.
        - Tested OK with Rosegarden and Ardour, but they do not seem to have an option to sync to the input midi clock, 
           only MTC or internally. Must test when MTC output added to MusE. 
      * Improved: Midi sync editor window: Shows MMC and MTC activity and works with them now. (T356)
21.01.2010
      * Fixed: First tests: External midi sync in works now! Should be rock solid no matter what is thrown at it. (T356)
        - All changes are labeled "p3.3.25"
        - Switched to a 'direct drive' method instead of 'calculation of tempo' method.
          Drift between source of master and slave is non-existant since the incoming midi clocks 
           drive the midi engine directly. This is at the expense of exact 64th note resolution.
          At MusE's fixed 24 midi clocks per quarternote, triplet 32nd notes are resolved (32nd note divided by three).
          MusE's default 'division' (ticks per quarternote) is 384. 384/24 gives a division of 16 MusE 'ticks' per midi clock.
        - Normally when using the tempo map (external sync is off), device play event times are in frames,
           because the tempo map provides for that kind of sub-tick frame resolution.
          But now, during external sync, device play event times are in ticks, not frames. 
          Hence the compromise between exactness of note times, and master/slave drift.
        - Tested heavily with a Roland TR-505 which has a variable 'analog' tempo knob.  
          Combined that with a complete midi song, and other test 'tick' tracks driving external synth KB,
           was rock solid going 'absolutely nuts' with the tempo knob up to 260BPM, surprisingly good resolution.
        - TODO: Check safety of 'midiExtSyncTicks = 0' inside audio thread while midi thread is counting it up.
          Also fix seek operations and check for any more place needing these 'tick'frame' alterations.
      * Changed: Some more changes for compressed files operations. (T356)
        - More to be done, but tests OK so far.    
19.01.2010
      * Fixed: Saving/loading compressed .gz/.bz2 MusE .med files, + loading compressed .mid/.kar files (save broken, off for now). (T356)
        - Changed filedialog.cpp:getSaveFileName() and MusE::loadProjectFile1.
        - Added seperate save file dialog filters in globals.cpp.
        - Disabled exporting of compressed midi/karaoke files (.mid/.kar) for now because
           a compressed file is opened as a pipe, and pipes can't seek, resulting in a 
           corrupted midi file in MidiFile::writeTrack(). 
18.01.2010
      * Added: Piano roll and drum editor edit menus: "Select prev/next part". With default hotkeys Alt+Left/Right. (T356) 
        - This is an easy way to switch parts when multiple part editing in one window (via Ctrl-E or Ctrl-D).
          And it was absolutely essential, for multiple dedicated controller track editing since there are no notes,
           and no (other) way to select another part to edit.
17.01.2010
      * Feature: MusE now has two mixers, with selectable track type display. (T356)
        - Changes to .med file were needed. Tested OK so far with old and new song files.
      * Fixed: Builtin freeverb and TAP reverb ladspa GUIs, or custom user GUIs not showing controls. (T356)
        - Broken since removal of musewidgetsplugin library months ago.
          Added PluginWidgetFactory class to handle local creation of controls.
          (Custom user GUIs must be done by hand since the removal of musewidgetsplugin library).
      * Fixed: Appearance settings red colour adjustment larger than others. (T356)
      * Changed: Default controller graph foreground colour from blue to medium orange. (T356)
        - Avoid clash with blue colour used by left and right markers.
12.01.2010
      * Release: 1.0.1 (rj)
10.01.2010
      * Fixed: python detection exchanged for script from http://libvirt.org/ (rj)
09.01.2010
      * Removed: Disabled watchdog thread. (T356)
        - Tested OK (normally) without it, although behaviour needs to be tested if audio or midi thread
           would stop unexpectedly.
      * Changed/Fixed: Thread priorites: Added command line switches for audio (-P) and midi (-Y). (T356)
        - Audio (-P) applies to dummy driver only. (Else audio priority is fixed by Jack).   
        - Also changed default settings so that no two threads have same priority. May fix problem reported
           by user GB, concerning high midi latency.
      * Added: Enable/disable LASH command line switch (-L), (if LASH support is compiled in). (T356)
        - Helps prevent some issues like auto-starting Jack, or automatically routing midi to fluidsynth (observed).
07.01.2010
      * Fixed: BUG ID: 2879426: *.med does not save meta event types. (T356)
        - Changed midievent.cpp MidiEventBase::write(). Now saves value A, B, C and sysex/meta data. Tested OK.  
      * Fixed: Midi meters now show for each track even if they're all on same device and channel. (T356)
        - Oversight, long overdue. The meters AND automation control needed to be 'per-track'.
      * Applied: muse-destdir.patch Scripts and utils packaging fix submitted by Orcan Ogetbil. (T356)
06.01.2010
      * Feature: Jack transport enable/disable in Midi Sync settings window. Stores setting per-song. (T356)
        - Should be Ok to use and test. Needs a bit more work. See jack.cpp and jackaudio.h
      * Fixed: Speedups of audio pre-fetch especially when moving the cursor around (seeking). (T356)
23.12.2009:
      * Added: DeicsOnze2 initial import. (ng)
      * Fix: deicsonzepreset.cpp for Xml muse 1 API
20.12.2009:
      =======================================
      * 1.0 tagged (rj)
      =======================================
19.12.2009:
      * Feature/Fix: Audio metronome: Send output tracks now selectable in Settings->Metronome. Also fixed bad noises.(T356)
15.12.2009:
      * Patch: New patch for 64-bit memory issues, from Daniel Kobras (rj)
      * Reworked: Output of configure script to point out deprecated stuff and list the interesting stuff (rj)
      * Fixed: Old bug: WaveTrack muting slow to respond or odd behaviour. (T356)
        - Removed track mute check in WaveTrack::fetchData(). Was causing 'delayed repeated muting' since the mute check is
           done at a time when audio segments are fetched which are to played a few seconds into the future.
          Tested OK so far, playing and bouncing wavetracks. Mute is now quick to respond and does not 'repeat' or 'delay'.
14.12.2009:
      * Fixed: Overhauled AudioTrack processing. Fixes noises if multiple output routes exist. Eliminates costly redundant
                processing of audio tracks, and their effects racks. Waves, groups, inputs, outputs, synths etc. (T356)
        - Made better use of AudioTrack::outBuffers, as a 'post-effect/pre-volume' caching mechanism if the track has more than one 
           output route. WaveTrack was already using this scheme, but I moved it up 'higher' and now all tracks benefit from it.
        - See AudioTrack::copyData() and ::addData(). Most changes there. (Comments included!)
      * Fixed: Old songs made before recent synth changes were not loading their synths. (T356)
        - In .med file, added synth 'label' tag to go with existing 'class' tag, to support synths like dssi-vst.
        - Songs made recently after the changes might not load their synths and will simply have to be re loaded and re-saved.
07.12.2009:
      * Fixed: Add Synth popup menu: Show names AND descriptions. Now sorted, too. Also separate MESS, DSSI, VST, and Other. (T356)
        - Added app.cpp:populateAddSynth() function.
      * Fixed: Increased buffers for reading xml. Song files with large patchdata from vstis caused crashes (rj)
      * Fixed: Self inflicted bug with setting inital song loading in general configuration (rj)
06.12.2009:
      * Fixed: List popup synths by description. Cleaned up soft synth main list. Added persistent names, descriptions, ver, etc. (T356)
05.12.2009:
      * Fixed: ddsi synths: Ticking or crackling when more than one output route path. (T356)
        - The synths were being run more than once per process cycle, due to multiple out routes eventually calling getData.
        - ** Work in progress - must also do MESS synths and other track types which should only process once per cycle. 
      * Feature: SSE support configure build option and SSE enabled dsp routines added. (T356)  
        - Currently none of the routines are actually used, yet... Borrowed from MusE-2.
        - They appear to only be enabled for 64-bit CPUs. Investigating why not 32-bit...
      * Feature: i386 optimized dsp float buffer copy routines. (T356)
        - Should work on all i386 compatible CPUs (uses asm movsl). Borrowed from MusE-2
        - I couldn't bear to add yet another unoptimized memcpy usage, so I added this.
      * Changed: All audio buffers now allocated with 'posix_memalign' instead of 'new'. (T356)
        - Borrowed from MusE-2.
03.12.2009:
      * Fixed: Support for initial vst chunk storage support if available in dssi-vst 
        requires a patch to dssi-vst.
      * Fixed: Better cleanup on closing MusE. (T356)
        - Added Song::cleanupForQuit called from Muse::closeEvent. Disconnect gracefully from LASH before app quit.
          Clean up memory. Make vst synth processes which were in undo or redo list at close go away.
02.12.2009:
      * Fixed: Do not send default midi values back to dssi synths. Let them handle their own default setting mechanisms. (T356)
        - Also saves a bit of loading time for synths with hundreds of controls. See MidiPort::setMidiDevice(). 
02.12.2009:
      * Fixed: dssi: Crashes when loading most vst synths. (T356)
        - All ports must be connected even if not used.
          Made sure all audio in/out and control in/out ports are connected,
           including latency control out port. Test Ok.
30.11.2009:
      * Added: Configuration option for vst plugin in-place processing, fixes ladspa vst plugins not working or loud feedback. (T356)
        - Hmmm, they were working before when I upgraded OS. Now they're not. Extensive testing: It seems this is not MusE's fault.
        - R.J. reports they weren't working too. Investigating...
29.11.2009:
      * Fixed: dssi: Loading of synths with more than 2 out channels. (T356)
        - Currently only the FIRST TWO channels of the synth will be used.
        - Tested ok so far with A.D. drumkit.
28.11.2009:
      * Fixed: dssi: List only synths found, not effect plugins. (T356)
        - Does the exact opposite of what dssi-vst does for ladspa plugins,
           therefore all plugins should be covered - effects will be listed 
           in ladspa effect dialog, while synths will be listed as synths.
27.11.2009:
      * Fixed: dssi: Both native guis and vst guis should open now. Ooooh - pretty! (T356)
        - ** But still: Keep an eye on your process list and manually kill any 
           synth instances lying around after exit. For now try to 'politely' 
           close dssi guis and delete any dssi synth tracks before exiting muse.
        - Working on gui open-close-reopen-show-hide stuff. Kinda weird esp. with vsts right now...
26.11.2009:
      * Fixed: Loading dssi crash bug. Should at least load them now. (T356)
        - Also some controller functionality via track controllers...
25.11.2009:
      * Feature: Dis.. Dis.. Disposable wha? (T356)
        - dssi support. Work in progress. 
        - ** VERY IMPORTANT Currently you must manually 'kill' any synth instances lying around after exit !!!
        - Should work OK for tests and fun...
22.11.2009:
      * Added: Support for reading ogg files through libsndfile (rj)
18.11.2009:
      * Fixed: Audio and synth tracks not processing when output path ultimately leads nowhere. (T356)
        - ALL tracks now always animate meters, and process audio 'quietly', and synth tracks
           process their gui messages, if output path leads nowhere.
        - This fixes a few problems: For example fluidsynth was not allowing loading of soundfonts.
          And synths would suddenly 'dump' any backlogged events when processing was turned back on.
          And during play, when disconnecting and reconnecting the track outputs, the audio would be 
           out of sync because it was not processed during that time.
        - See Audio::process1() to understand the changes more. Follow from there to SynthI, SynthIF etc.  
      * Fixed: Minor issue with port 0 display in track list port column for synths, from previous fix. (T356)  
17.11.2009:
      * Changed again: Arranger: Track list: Left click synth track's port column now lets you choose a port. (T356)
      * Fixed: Do not list synths as instruments in ports/synths settings window. (T356)
16.11.2009:
      * Added: Script functionality moved from PianoRoll to song class, available in main menu (under 'Midi') 
        and drum editor (mg)
      * Added: 'Add synth' sub-menus now automatically assign the instance to a free midi port. (T356)
15.11.2009:
      * Added: Added 'Add synth' sub-menu to main 'Edit menu' and Mixer 'Create' menu. (T356) 
      * Changed: All audio track types now start with two channels and 0db volume. (Input tracks remain muted as usual). (T356)
      * Fixed: Organ synth: Drawbar harmonics and sustain midi controllers were not working. (T356)
        - Applied auto-bias corrections.
14.11.2009:
      * Added: DoubleSpeed plugin script for PianoRoll (mg)
      * Fixed: Disable Python ifdefs (mg)
13.11.2009:
      * Feature: Mixer labels: Auto-Font-Size(TM) using Appearance Settings font # 6. Word wrap (only with spaces) supported. (T356)
        - The mixer labels will try to fit the text, trying font size from font #6 point size down to point size = 5.
      * Feature: Arranger: Track list: Right-click 'Add ...' now lists soft synths ! (T356)
      * Feature: Arranger: Track list: Left/right click synth track's output port column now shows synth gui ! (T356)
      * Changed: Midi track info: Removed redundant track name box, changed label to behave like mixer strip. (T356)
      * Fixed:   Appearance Settings: Manual entry into font name boxes now works. (T356)
      * Fixed:   Appearance Settings: Added tooltips to font #0 - #6. Explains which font does what. (T356)
12.11.2009:
      * Fixes: Some Python API refcount code added (mg)
10.11.2009:
      * Added: Effect disable/enable + add/remove track to Python API (mg)
09.11.2009:
      * Feature: Added 'Echo recording to output' button to midi track info panel. (T356)
        - Turns on or off echoing of incoming record events to output device.
      * Fixed: Midi tracks not recording when no output device selected. (T356)
        - Now tracks will record with no output device selected.
      * Fixed: Problems since increasing number of midi ports from 16 to 32 several months ago. (T356)
        - Added Xml::parseUInt() and ::uintTag(), utils.cpp:u32bitmap2String() and string2u32bitmap().
        - Fixed saving and loading of input port mask in med files.
        - Fixed display of input port mask in track info panel.
08.11.2009:
      * Added: First test shot at part managing app in Python (mg)
      * Added: Python api functions for selected track + import of part file (mg)
06.11.2009
      * Fixed: Python configure.ac problems. (T356)
      * Removed: musewidgetsplugin (QT3 Designer widgets plugin) which may cause CVS build to fail with libtool2. (T356)
        - Infamous '-o' trick no longer required to build from CVS. Removed until further notice. 
04.11.2009
      * Added: Shortcuts to drumeditor + pianoroll: goto current pos, scroll left + right (mg)
      * Fixed: Added command line switch (-y) for enabling Python control - disabled as default (mg)
      * Added: Shortcut keys added to pianoroll and drumeditor (mg)
      * Added: Startup dialog showing 'good to know' info, can be disabled (rj)
      * Added: Song info dialog, can be used to record song related arbitrary text information (rj)
      * Changed: the output limiter is now configurale, and by default off (rj)
      * Fixed: Midi loop recording now honours the transport cycle record mode setting. (T356)
        - Cycle mode REPLACE: Only record notes in current loop. Erase any previous loop notes from rec stop pos to loop end.
        - Cycle mode NORMAL: Same as REPLACE, but don't erase any previous loop notes from rec stop pos to loop end.
        - Cycle mode MIX: Keep all recorded notes from all loops.
        - Use the transport record mode OVERDUB or REPLACE as usual to either mix with or replace existing track notes.
      * Fixed: Midi record (incl. new part, looping, part auto-extend) now honours the arranger snap selection. (T356)
        - Previously the left and right ends of the part would always be 'snapped' to bars, and any new notes recorded 
           past the end would not snap the part.  
      * Changed: muse/mpevent.h: Changed MREL list from using audioRTalloc to midiRTalloc. (T356)
        - This must have been a mistake? midiRTalloc was not even being used anywhere before. The comment lines gave clues. 
      * Fixed: Multiple copies of wave events appearing in wave parts after resizing part. (T356)
        - Changed EventList::find() to respect wave or midi. D'oh! Missed this obvious one from changes I made many months ago.
      * Fixed: Audio loop recording now respects arranger snap setting. (T356)
        - Previously the left and right ends of the part would always be 'snapped' to bars.
      * Fixed: Audio recording now respects punchin and punchout points. (T356)  
      * Fixed: Audio loop recording now works (currently replace mode only). (T356)  
        - WORK IN PROGRESS: Only overwrite (replace) mode supported. Working on overdub mode...
        - If recording is started INSIDE the loop points, then allowed to loop, the
           'zeroth loop' wave contents will be 'shifted' back to the left loop point.
          This may have to change if mix mode is to be supported. In other words 
           keep that 'zeroth' portion of wave in place. May change it anyway. 
02.11.2009
      * Added: Midi track controller + audio track volume to Python interface (mg)
28.10.2009
      * Fixed: No, or badly shifted wave recording, since libsndfile 2008-05-11 (T356)
        - Fix for recorded waves being shifted ahead by an amount equal to start record position.
        - Removed _recFile->seek() in AudioTrack::record(). Since libsndfile 2008-05-11, "seeking past 
           end of file during write" is allowed, which caused problem with the line seeking the record
           file to an absolute frame which *included* the recording start position.
25.10.2009
      * Added: Mute functionality to Python interface (mg)
      * Fixed: Midi mixerstrip mute update issues (mg)
      * Fixed: initialization in pandelay ladspa plugin (rj) 
21.10.2009:
      * Added: functions for looping to Python interface (mg)
19.10.2009:
      * Added: more functions to Python interface: deletePart, set position of locators, get/set song 
      length, get division, set midi track parameters (mg)
      * Added: now possible to create and modify parts via Python bridge (mg)
18.10.2009
      * Added: backported ladspa plugins doublechorus and pandelay from svn-muse (rj)
      * Fixed: Mixer was not updating when a midi track's channel was changed. (T356)
        - Created a new song changed flag SC_MIDI_CHANNEL and used it to only update mixer midi strips,
           not the whole mixer. Changed AudioMixerApp::songChanged() and ::updateMixer().
      * Fixed: Mixer was not shrinking enough when a track was removed, leaving space between strips. (T356)
        - Added a couple of lines to AudioMixerApp::updateMixer() STRIP_REMOVED section.
      * Fixed: Bug with reading soundfonts from song dir fixed (rj)
17.10.2009
      * Examples: added some example scripts, DoNothing and RemoveShortEvents (currently requires PyQt4) (rj)
      * Added: more tags to plugin format in pianoroll, see readme in dist: share/scripts (rj)
      * Added: Updates to Python API, now possible to modify part data. Needs a lot of testing (mg)
16.10.2009
      * Added: Added a few functions to Python remote API (start/stop playback + location queries)
      * Feature: Each drum instrument listed in the drum map now has a playback 'volume' setting. (T356)
        - Currently it affects playback only. I am looking to maybe add record level, too.
      * Changed: Default drum map velocity level 3 (110) and 4 (127), now 127, 110. (T356)
        - To allow easy (no key hold) drawing of default 110 velocity notes.
          (Hold shift = 127, ctl= 90, shift+ctl = 70)
      * Fixed: Drum editor controller graphs now align perfectly with editor canvas. (T356)
        - Changed DrumEdit::newCanvasWidth().
        - Tested OK with various appearance themes, and various vertical splitter positions.
      * Fixed: Drum map length, velocity level, and volume columns rapid mid-/right- clicks causing left double-clicks. (T356)
        - Now the columns can be quickly mid and right clicked (decrement/increment).
      * Fixed: Fluidsynth now realizes that a soundfont was located in the song-dir and then omitts 
        the path in the configuration data. (rj)
      * Changed: Changed the format of the datafile for the automation option in the pianoroll
        Mathias, we can wrestle about it later ;-)   (rj)
15.10.2009
      * Feature: First version of MusE remote Python control (mg)
      * Fixed: Drum canvas 'select' functions not updating, can't copy/cut etc. (T356)
        - Added updateSelection() to the end of DrumCanvas::cmd(). Tested OK.
12.10.2009
      * Feature: External scripting functionality added via PianoRoll menu: (mg)
         PianoRoll scans INSTPREFIX/share/muse/scripts and ~/.muse/scripts for executables, which modify part 
         data via data stored in temporary file

25.08.2009
      * Proposal: new default colors for various stuff (rj)
12.08.2009
      * Fixed: bug 2811156, soft synth and marker window no longer appear when hidden for XFCE window manager (rj)
15.07.2009
      * Patch: from bug 2819312 (by Gerardo Exequiel Pozzi) added. Allows muse to launch with never glibc. The fix is
        perhaps not fully understood but it looks harmless. (rj)
09.07.2009
      * Changed: Track info program, vol, and pan spinboxes now lose focus with one enter press instead of two. (T356)
05.07.2009
      * Fixed: Small fix on behalf of T356, Jack should not be started if running -a (rj)
      * Fixed: Help menu -> Report a Bug: Set address to current muse org bug address. (T356)
01.07.2009
      * Fixed: Dropdown menus in transport no longer grab focus, make space start/stop work again (rj)
      * Fixed: Dropdown in Mastertrack editor no longer grabs focus (rj)
      * Feature: Added denormal protection, by default on, can be turned off in global config (rj)
25.06.2009
      * Fixed: Recording of midi sysex was not working. (T356)
        - My fault since recent midi sync changes. Fixed the last few lines in alsaProcessMidiInput().
      * Fixed: Segfault when certain movements are done in track list. (T356)
        - Added valid track check to RESIZE section of TList::mouseMoveEvent(), 
           and a few other places.
23.06.2009
      * Testing: A fix for some Jack-2 net problems...  (T356)
        - Added missing break statements, and JackTransportNetStarting detection 
           (hard-coded as '4' for now so that muse will build with Jack 1 and 2 - we need 
           config detection of Jack version!) to processSync(), and JackAudioDevice::getState().
21.06.2009
      * Feature: Added Jack freewheel mode. (T356)
        - Dramatically speeds up bounce to file and bounce to track operations.
          With freewheel enabled, you don't have to wait for Muse to play the song 
           at normal speed while bouncing - it goes as fast as possible.
        - Added configuration option for it. See 'Global Settings -> Audio'.
20.06.2009
      =======================================
      * 1.0rc3 tagged (rj)
      =======================================
      * Feature: Jack transport master functionality added. (T356)
        - Allows other Jack client apps to properly disply Muse's current bar, beat, and tick.
        - Especially useful for songs with tempo and time signature changes.
        - It is activated / deactivated by clicking on Muse's transport 'Master', 
           or Muse's graphic Mastertrack window 'Enable'.
17.06.2009
      * Fixed: Segfault after creating simpledrums instance, then adding a midi track. (T356)
        - Return non zero in SimpleSynth::getPatchName().
15.06.2009
      * Removed: Some code in jack driver which may cause shutdowns or static noise with Jack version 1 (T356)
        - Tested several hours here, no shutdowns or sudden static noise. Thanks to the Jack team for that one...
13.06.2009
      * Fixed: New midi right-click popup menu 'add/set event' and 'erase event' not working for drum controllers. (T356)
        - Also, on 'add/set', added check and ignore if an existing event value is already equal. 
      * Fixed: Midi track info vol, pan, prog 'Rec' buttons were allowing duplicate events. (T356)
        - Added check for existing event in Song::recordEvent().
        - Also added check and ignore if event value is already equal.
10.06.2009
      * Fixed: Link error concerning libmidiedit.a and CtrlEdit.a (T356)
        - Somehow the list of link libraries was out of order. Reordered, tested OK.
05.06.2009
      * Fixed: Users in some locales reported audio automation save/load corruption. (T356)
        - Changed CtrlList::read() to use QString and QLocale instead of strtol() and strtod().
        - Checked: Other places using QString::toDouble() work OK because QString will fallback 
           to 'C' locale if formatting using current locale fails. (Hmm... But is it a speed hit?)
      * Fixed: When linking, get errors concerning uuid functions not found. (T356)
        - Added a section in configure.ac to test for uuid.h and libuuid.
        - Added uuid lib to list of linked libs.
      * Fixed: Midi port controller values not erased upon song load. (T356)
        - There were leftover ghost values in the controller graphs between song loads.
        - Added MidiCtrlValListList::clearDelete(), called from Song::clear().
      * Added: Right-click automation popup menu to all midi controller knobs/sliders. (T356)
        - Contains add/set event, and erase event.
        - When activated by the muse mixer midi controls, it 'prefers' selected parts on the track
           over unselected parts, otherwise it chooses the first part found. If no part is found, 
           it creates a new one to contain the event.
        - When activated by pianoroll or drum editor controller graph, it uses the currently 
           selected part (within the editor).
        - Adding 'previous event', 'next event', 'erase range' and 'clear automation', just like
           the audio automation popup menu, will take more time. Not implemented yet.
      * Disabled: Midi mixer strip automation type button. (T356)
        - There is no midi automation recording mechanism (yet). Disabled to avoid confusion with users.
      * Added: Some new instrument .idf files submitted by MST (Michael). (T356) 
        - Akai SG01v, Korg MS2000R, Korg X5DR, Korg X50, Waldorf MicroQ.
02.06.2009
      * Applied: Some patches by Mandriva packagers. (T356)
        - muse-1.0-fix-str-fmt.patch for deicsonze printf fix.
        - muse-1.0-linkage.patch fixes compiler hang up at deicsonze.cpp.
01.06.2009
      * Fixed: Instrument editor 'Save as' was not working right. (T356)
        - Was overwriting existing instrument.
        - Now prompts for new instrument name.
      * Added text in ctrl view to explain how to add controller values (rj)

24.05.2009
      * Fixed: Missing uuid header in two files. (T356)
        - My fault. Added include uuid/uuid.h to songfile.cpp and pcanvas.cpp.
      * Fixed: Bounce to track: Wrong message "Select one audio output track", to "Select one target wave track". (T356)
        - My fault. Message is displayed when there is one output and one or more wave tracks, and the user has clicked 
           on the output but not a track, too.
      * Added: Start 'Wave editor' edit menu item, with configurable shortcut key. (T356)
        - This will handle mutiple wave part editing. The existing right-click wave part popup menu
           'wave edit' item did that too, but now has been reverted back to opening a single 
           wavepart only, just like midi parts. 
      * Streamlined: All reading of 'part' xml is now done by a new routine. (T356)
        - Replaced new PartCanvas::readClone(), and existing Part::read(), with standalone readXmlPart(),
           in order to block creation of parts with mis-matched type, which don't belong on a track.
        - Allowed mixed part .mpt files (midi and wave), and made a new clipboard type 'text/mixedpart'.
        - Mixed part files can be dragged, imported or pasted to either a wave or midi track, and only the 
           relevant parts will be created. 
        - Added warning dialog showing how many, of how many total, parts couldn't be created.
        - Added a parameter to Event::write() and EventBase::write() to force full wave file paths to be stored.
          Used for copying, pasting, dragging, importing, exporting parts, but not for the song file itself.
       * Added: Right-click wave part popup menu now has 'export', just like midi parts. (T356)
        - As mentioned above, the full wave path is stored so there's minimum confusion when re-loading 
           the export, unless of course the file moved or was deleted etc.
       * Fixed: Some issues with clones, controller events, and port controller values. (T356)
        - It means "What you see on the controller graph is what you get, when you move the play cursor."
          Port controller values are used when moving the cursor, they make the knobs move and send
           values to the midi port. However, during play, they are not used, the song's controller events
           themselves are used. Synchronizing these two mechanisms is what this is all about.
          Fortunately, during play, "What you see on the controller graph" is ALWAYS correct, and is sent 
           to the midi port. 
        - TODO: Not quite done yet. Some functions may not update port controller values properly still,
           like splitting or gluing clone parts.
06.05.2009
      =======================================
      * 1.0rc2 tagged (rj)
      =======================================

02.05.2009
      * Feature: Right-click popup menu on a clone part now has "Select N clones", where N is number of clones. (T356)
        - Major addition: Part "clone chaining system". (See part.cpp for new functions). Speeds up searches for clones.
      * Feature: Added 'Paste clone' to arranger edit menu. Pastes clones of copied parts. (T356)
        - 'Paste' will behave as always, only making a fresh copy of non-clone parts, while cloning clone parts.
        - 'Paste clone' will always make a clone no matter if the parts are clones or non-clones.
      * Feature: Added 'Paste to track' and 'Paste clone to track' to arranger edit menu. (T356)
        - 'Paste' (and 'Paste clone') now attempt to paste to the original track(s) which the parts belonged to, 
           or if the original track has been deleted, then the current track. 
          'Paste to track' and 'Paste clone to track' paste all copied parts to the currently selected track, 
           which was the previous behaviour of 'Paste'.
        - Much work went into making sure that all scenarios work with these features, like copy/paste, drag/drop, 
           drag/drop .mpt part files, drag/drop between different instances of muse etc.
      * Fixed: Importing or dragging midi part file (.mpt) into muse now supports multiple parts in the file. (T356)
        - Changed MusE::importPartToTrack().  
      * Fixed: Midi record into existing part past part end, in 'Replace' record mode, works now. (T356)
        - Finished an erase events 'TODO' block in Song::cmdAddRecordedEvents.
      * Fixed: Midi record into existing part, past part end, was decreasing part aref count, causing de-clone of clones. (T356)
        - Removed extra "part->events()->incARef(-1)" from Song::cmdAddRecordedEvents().
      * Changed: Number of midi ports from 16 to 32. (T356)     
      * Added: Muse application desktop file, and added installation of it plus the muse icon, upon 'make install'. (T356)
        - Desktop file submitted by Orcan Ogetbil.
        - Note if muse is installed to /usr/local, the desktop file might not find the icon.
      * Fixed: "-mcpu= is deprecated" compiler warnings. (T356)
        - Changed configure.ac to use -mtune and -march.
      * Speedups: Some heartBeat routines (such as Meter) were constantly drawing, wasting time and causing flicker. (T356)
        - Also fixed Track Info midi detect light, and Midi Sync lights.
      * Fixed: Midi strip vu meters now have a peak indicator. (T356)
      * Fixed: Audio mixer strips now update when config minimum meter/slider value changed. (T356)
        - Also fixed blocky 'aliased' drawing at low signals / low minimum meter settings.
        - Changed Track::_meter and ::_peak from ints to doubles for more accuracy, eliminate 'false' draw update triggers.
      * Added: Configurable shortcut key: "Transport: Goto start". Default 'W' key (as in reWind to start). (T356)
      * Added: Appearance configuration button: Clear background picture. (T356)
        - Also fixed Appearance::apply() to clear the string if <none> selected.
        - Also fixed Arranger::configChanged() to set canvas null background QPixmap.
        - This means clearing the filename in the 'select picture' dialog also works now. 
      * Changed: Selected cloned parts now draw (inverted) dashed border, just like unselected parts. (T356)
      * Changed: Part drag-clone key from Shift-Ctrl back to Alt. (T356)
        - My fault. Was changed to Shift-Ctrl, but Ctrl is for selecting all items in a row or limiting movement to x or y. 
        - Still not a good thing. Some desktops even reserve Alt, Shift-Alt etc. for window move, snap etc.
        - TODO: Must find a way to override desktop setting. Without Alt, we don't have enough keys to work with!
          Don't want user to have to disable setting.
      * Cleanups: Moved some methods outside of Part and Track classes which I had put inside them. (T356)
        - Methods like addPortCtrlEvents() deletePortCtrlEvents() etc.
      * Changed: Muse wants qt >= 3.2, but some .ui files had version 3.3. (T356)
        - Changed editinstrumentbase, editgainbase, aboutbox, configmidifilebase, gensetbase, midisync, 
           fluidsynthguibase, and vamguibase .ui files.
      * Fixed: Midi Track info panel was allowing track name change to an already existing name. (T356)
        - Fixed Arranger::iNameChanged() to warn. Changing the name in the arranger Track List already warns OK.
      * Fixed: Crash or bizarre behaviour when undoing a track rename operation. (T356)
        - Replaced default simple Track class assignment operator with custom method. Added a flag parameter to 
           Track::clone and Track copy constructors to indicate partlist is simply assigned, not parts cloned. 
           Also removed the lines reassigning each part's track (!). Can get away with this since track rename 
           is the only operation to use that, but something better would be needed if more 'normal' behaviour 
           was needed in copy constructor and assignment operator !
05.04.2009
      * Fixed: Arranger part cloning works now! (Hold shift-ctrl while moving part - note dashed border on cloned parts). (T356)
        - In Song::cmdChangePart() do not call "oldPart->events()->incARef(-1)" if new part is clone of old part,
           (that is, old/new parts' eventlists point to same eventlist).
        - Changed from 'alt' to 'Shift-Ctrl' button combo to activate cloning in Canvas::viewMousePressEvent().
          Alt is reserved for moving the whole window (on my machine), so most people probably never knew about cloning? 
        - This also fixes a reference count problem when renaming a part, ref count was being dec'd past 0. 
          Quite possibly fixes some other issues, too. Testing...
      * Fixed: Transport window was disappearing by itself. (T356)
        - Removed WStyle_Tool from Transport constructor. Seems to test Ok now.
        - Gave it a caption "Muse: Transport", to appear on task bar.
      * Fixed: Big time display now shows MTC minutes, seconds, frames, and subframes. (T356)
      * Fixed: Wave editor MTC cursor time readout was not right. (T356)
        - Use samplepos to set pos2 value in WaveEdit::setTime().
03.04.2009
      * Followup: Track info panel program, volume, and pan were not allowing editing values. (T356)
        - Fixed the track info heartBeat function.
      * Followup: Some more changes to respect MidiDevice open flags, set in midi config window. (T356)
        - Strangely, midi config 'write enable' lights still weren't stopping events from being played, 
           even though the port was clearly unsubscribed successfully for writing (!) 
          Also, strangely, only if Jack Midi was disabled, some device putEvent() error messages were appearing.
          I expected the messages to ALWAYS occur but it didn't happen, even though events were always played. 
        - Added MidiDevice::_writeEnable and ::_readEnable, set when the device is opened or closed. 
        - Changed the various ::putEvent methods to respect _writeEnable. (_readEnable not used yet, because
           port unsubscribtion for reading IS working - events stop arriving).
      * Added: Instrument definition file for playing to an Emu 4MBGSMT SoundFont. (T356)
01.04.2009
      * Fixed: Midi config window: Clicking on green in/out enable lights was not actually dis/enabling in/out. (T356)
        - As initiated from MPConfig::rbClicked(), MidiAlsaDevice::close() was seeing the NEW flags, not the old.
          So, in MidiAlsaDevice::close(), removed _openFlags check, and added snd_seq_get_port_subscription() check.
        - Tested Ok disabling/enabling ins/outs, and clearing/setting port's device.
      * Fixed: Muse was not storing midi port 'openFlags' in the song files. (T356)
        - Muse could read the old 'record' flag and the new 'openFlags' tags, but only stored the 
           old 'record' tag (well, it was actually storing rwFlags by mistake).
        - Added the necessary tag to file write. (Related to the fix above - now it stores the port in/out enable).
01.04.2009
      * Fixed: Compile problem with muse widgets plugin "undefined reference to `main'". (T356)
          - Added -c to musewidgetsplugin_so_CPPFLAGS in muse/widgets/Makefile.am
          - Re-ran automake, configure, built, tested ok.
          - To be tested by users...
      * Fixed: Compile error: "editctrlbase.cpp:53: error: invalid use of incomplete type 'struct PosEdit'" (T356)
          - Added a <customwidget> section to editctrlbase.ui
          - To be tested by users...
31.03.2009
      * Feature: Midi file export: Configuration options added for 2 or 4 byte time signatures + note off optimizations. (T356)
        - For 4 byte timesigs: Add fixed "metronome" value of 24 (once per quarter-note), and "32nd notes per quarter-note" value of 8. 
        - For note off optimizations: Replace note offs with zero velocity note ons.   
      * Fixed: Midi track info panel now updates when external changes occur, such as keyboard program changes. (T356)
        - Changed track info window from songChanged based updates to periodic heartBeatTimer based updates.
      * Feature: Added midi input detect indicator to track info panel. (T356)
        - Detects all note on-off, controller, aftertouch, program change, and pitchbend (but not sysex or realtime) 
           events on the selected channels, on the selected midi ports.  
      * Fixed: Midi program adjustment controls now respond when external program changes occur. (T356)    
        - Added a section to handle ME_PROGRAM in MidiPort::sendEvent(), so that visual controls can update,
           such as trackinfo 'program' , and pianoroll 'program' controller adjustment knob.
      * Fixed: Some issues with 'Follow Song' setting and position cursor position/visibility. (T356)
        - Added 'xorg' in ppos calculations in Canvas::setPos() (and others like WaveView, but that still isn't quite right.)
        - For windows which have an appreciable x origin (space at the left of the contents), the play cursor was 
           too far right or not visible sometimes, especialy with large horizontal zoom, particularly the arranger.
          With 'Follow Continuous', the play cursor should now stay about in the middle of the windows. 
          With 'Follow Page', the view should now more or less always move in full 'pages'. 
27.03.2009
      * Fixed: Track info 'instrument patch' list box was not correct when selecting another track with unknown patch. (T356)
        - Broken last fixes.
      * Improved: Support for & < > \ " characters in xml files. (T356)
        - Fixed xml.cpp
        - Many places in muse can now use them (ex. track name, instrument names/patches/controllers etc.)
        - TODO: Writing: Must still check for places which manually use Xml::nput, put etc, but at least muse 
           should now read them all without trouble.
      * Fixed: Instrument Editor was still asking to save sometimes even if user clicked save already. (T356)
        - Call instrumentNameReturn() patchNameReturn() and ctrlNameReturn() from various places, to force update.
      * Feature: Redesigned Midi Sync Editor and sync system. To allow multiple inputs/outputs, and more. (T356)
        - See tooltips or click on What's This to see detailed explanations of each item.
        - TODO: Only realtime MC events are tested at the moment. MMC and MTC are not tested, or not working yet. 
        - TODO: Fix midi sync clock input. Observed problems: wandering, even reversing(!) song cursor time.
          Can be stored in .med file that way (tempomap->fix is negative number!) making a bad file which won't play.
12.03.2009
      * Fixed: Global configuration dialog 'Displayed Resolution', and added 'Midi Resolution' boxes. (T356) 
        - Separate midi/gui configurations were allowed, but not implemented. 
        - TODO: Now make the 'Displayed Resolution' setting actually do something.
          The 'Midi Resolution' currently sets BOTH what should be separated into midi and gui.
          Only config.division is used throughout muse, not config.guiDivision.
          Also, now that these settings are working, they reveal some issues with drawing, such as
           not enough pianoroll zoom-out ability with high resolution.
      * Improved: Midi Clock output. Was improper, causing external devices to misbehave. (T356)
        - Changed MidiSeq::processTimerTick().
        - Tested: With RTC resolution at 8192, the target device slowly drifted out of phase with muse after 
          about 20 bars. With RTC resolution at 1024 it was actually more stable (100 bars or more), despite 
          more clock jitter.
          Used an equalization scheme to balance the time out. Must test if stability improves without this scheme. 
          MidiSeq::processTimerTick() still needs some tweaking. 
        - You may see severe phase difference if moving the cursor around and playing. Try playing from the song start.  
19.02.2009
      * Patch: Patch to find best available ALSA timer. (T356)
        - Submitted by Pedro Lopez-Cabanillas. Patch was named "muse_alsatimer_2nd.patch".
        - "This patch adds selection logic to ALSA timer initialization, trying to find 
            the best available ALSA timer (a non slave timer with lowest resolution).
           Currently muse uses only the ALSA system timer, even when the system has an 
           ALSA RTC or ALSA HPET drivers available, which are probably better for many users."
      * Patch: Patches for printf%zd/size_t, and grepMidi/gcc4.4 issues, and fix some compiler warnings. (T356)
        - Submitted by Orcan Ogetbil.
        - Patches were named muse-size_t.patch, muse-gcc44.patch, and muse-fix-some-compilation-warnings.patch
      * Fixed: Some more issues with manipulating drum tracks and underlying controller events. (T356)
        - Changing a drum track's output port, (and allowing muse to change the whole drum map),
           was not changing existing port controller values.
        - Also changing a track from 'midi' <-> 'drum' was not changing the port controller values properly.   
        - NOTE: I still observed occasional 'ghost' midi port controller values. Tracking this issue...
      * Fixed: Seek or Init Instrument with XG instrument caused double loading of controller init values. (T356) 
        - Moved controller init code from MidiPort::sendGm/XgOn() to a new MidiPort::sendGm/Gs/XgInitValues() 
           and changed Audio::initDevices() to call them.
      * Added: 'Value' readout on menu toolbar (beside 'Cursor' readout), in Drum Editor. (T356)
        - Just like pianoroll, except it only shows controller values. 
        - Now you can read the values you are drawing on the Drum Editor controller graph.
      * Fixed: Some issues with configuration, and appearance window. (T356)
        - Muse now remembers configured 'selected track foreground/background' colours. 
        - Added "Midi Editor -> controller graph" colour configuration option (default navy blue).
        - Fixed Arranger and Style/Fonts windows not showing current values.
      * Fixed: Segfault with Appearance configured to show events, with a part tick > 0 on part canvas. (T356)
        - Added limit checks on from/to variables in PartCanvas::drawItem().
      * Fixed: Midi controller graphs were displaying 'quantization' vertical lines instead of 'snap' lines. (T356)
        - Changed CtrlCanvas::draw() to use raster instead of quant value.
        - Also changed gray background colour to darkGray, so 'major' snap lines can be seen.
      * Added: Send 'null' midi controller parameters after each RPN/NRPN controler event. (T356)
        - Symptom: After muse sends any RPN/NRPN controller event, operating the 'data' (MSB/LSB) 
           midi controllers affects that RPN/NRPN controller.
        - Cause: The RPN/NRPN parameters are still active, open to any subsequent data adjustments.
        - Cure: Send 'null' parameters after each RPN/NRPN event, so that subsequent data adjustments
           are sent there instead.
        - Added adjustable 'null' parameter numbers to the instrument editor. Typically they should 
           be '127/127', but they are adjustable (select an unused controller number) if desired.
          They can also be turned off, if desired, by selecting 'off/off', so that muse will NOT send
           them. Turning them off is useful for instruments which do not use RPN/NRPN controllers.
      * Changed: GS/XG instrument patches high banks from 18 to 128, 17 to 127, and 5 to 65. (T356)
        - Was it a typo? XG specifications say high banks should be 128, 127, 65 etc.
        - Also, in instrument editor, reorganized XG Drum patches into Drum Kits and Sound FX.
        - TODO: Other instruments may have to be changed, too.
      * Fixed: Track info 'Rec' button: If new part was created, it was too short even to see. (T356)
        - Changed Song::recordEvent to round (tick + 1) up one bar.
        - Added separate record buttons for program (and bank), volume, and pan.
18.02.2009
      * Added: Missing midi program controller to pianoroll/drum edit controller graph and adjustment knob. (T356)
        - Since the range is limited to 1-128, this only edits the program byte, NOT the program MSB or LSB!
        - Since only the program byte is edited, adding new values to the graph uses the CURRENT 
           program MSB and LSB, as shown in the track info pane (H-Bank/L-Bank). 
           If the current program is 'unknown' (all off), then the graph uses MSB=off, LSB=off if the song type 
            is GM, and MSB=1, LSB=1 if not.  
        - I considered using the 'previous value' on the graph for the MSB/LSB, but then there would be 
           no way to quickly set the MSB/LSB when adding new values to the graph.
        - The only other way is to draw on the graph, and then use the midi event list editor to change 
           the program MSB/LSB values.
        - TODO: Fix the track info H-Bank/L-Bank/Program behaviour. Do not allow program to be 'off' 
           if H-Bank/L-Bank are not 'off'.
      * Changed: Instrument editor behaviour. Allow a 'user' instrument directory PLUS the 'built-in' directory. (T356)
        - Muse now looks first in the MUSEINSTRUMENTS directory (default MUSEHOME/muse_instruments, where MUSEHOME  
           is default HOME/), then looks in the 'built-in' instrument directory (/usr/share/muse etc.)
        - Instruments found in the user directory OVERRIDE instruments with the SAME NAME in the 'built-in' directory.
        - This allows users to quickly experiment with existing instruments while keeping the same instrument name.
        - TODO: add a 'Delete' button to the instrument editor.
      * Added: Pitch bend sensitivity controller to fluidsynth. (T356) 
      * Fixed: Organ synth: Volume not working. (T356)
        - There is no volume gui control to return proper min/max values.
        - Added a trap for CTRL_VOLUME in Organ::getControllerInfo() and
           set min/max to 0/127.
      * TODO: Fix some broken VAM synth midi controllers with improper range. (T356)     
09.02.2009
      * Fixed: Drum map: Grey vertical lines not proper when map header rearranged. (T356)
        - Used header->mapToSection when drawing grey vertical lines in dlist.cpp.
08.02.2009
      * Fixed: Drum map - Changing ANote, Channel, Port now updates controller graph and knob. (T356)
        - Changing ANote, Channel, or Port of a drum map item now updates the controller graph 
           and adjustment knob. Useful for XG/GS drum controllers.
        - TODO: Fix 'Undo' changing ANote, Channel, Port.
      * Fixed: Drum map - List item drag and drop works properly now. (T356)
        - Was not manipulating events properly, although port controller values were still OK.
          Useful for XG/GS drum controllers.
        - TODO: Fix 'Undo' of drag and drop.
      * Changed: All calls to some new message sending routines with direct calls. (T356)
        - Replaced all calls to msgSetTrackOutChannel, msgSetTrackOutPort, msgRemapPortDrumCtlEvents,
           and msgChangeAllPortDrumCtrlEvents, with direct calls (song->remapPortDrumCtlEvents etc.),
           bracketed by audio->msgIdle(true) and audio->msgIdle(false).
        - For complex operations, 'msgIdle' technique seems to be preferred over sending messages.
        - Tested such operations while in stop mode, and while playing. Tested OK.
06.02.2009
      * Changed: Hard coded LADSPA paths in plugin.cpp and ssplugin.cpp to include /usr/lib64/ladspa  
           and /usr/local/lib64/ladspa. (T356)
        - Suggested by Orcan Ogetbil    
        - Note that the environment variable LADSPA_PATH still overrides these hard-coded paths.
06.02.2009
      * Patch applied: Removes duplicate implementation of fast_log*() functions in ssplugin.h (T356)
        - Submitted by Orcan Ogetbil 
05.02.2009
      =======================================
      * 1.0rc1 tagged (rj)
      =======================================
04.02.2009
      * Fixed: Track info panel 'Rec' button not changing existing values on controller graph. (T356)
        - Name changes: MidiCtrlValList::add, ::del, ::find to ::addMCtlVal, ::delMCtlVal, ::findMCtlVal 
           to make it easier to spot all usages of them.
        - Simple fix in MidiCtrlValList::addMCtlVal: Return false if the value is already found for the part.
        - TODO: It takes three 'undos' to undo the 'Rec' button push. It is because prog, vol, and pan
           are changed. This should be unified into one undo...

01.02.2009
      * Fixed: Compile error on 64-bit systems, in audiotrack.cpp at cacheJackRouteNames(). (T356)
        - Changed from unsigned int pair key, which required pointer conversion, to AudioTrack* pair key. 
        - Test OK (on my 32-bit system). ** Need 64-bit users to test it. **
      * Fixed: Segfault when playing a note in a drum map, when the note's port says 'none'. (T356)
        - Added a line in the 'don't echo controller changes back to software synthesizer' block of
           Audio::processMidi(), to check valid device.
      * Fixed: Missing or stuck notes or events on recording (or rec-armed only) midi track. (T356)
        - Symptom: Playing live (rec-armed only), or recording, on a midi track gives stuck or 
           missing notes and other events. Very annoying bug!
        - Cause: A single list was used for recording midi events, while muse was also reading from that list.
        - Employed a 'flipping' two-list technique for MidiDevice::recordEvents().
        - In Audio::processMidi(), process one list while MidiDevice::recordEvent() writes to the other.
      * Fixed: Manipulating controller events in midi track parts was not changing midi port controller values. (T356)
        - Symptom: Change a part's midi controller events, or move or delete a part, or delete a track, then the underlying
           midi port's controller values are not altered, leading to 'phantom' or 'ghost', or duplicate controller values,
           even where there is no part or no track, or no controller values where there should be !
        - Oops, how did this major bug go unnoticed so long?...   
        - Major rewrite: Created a struct MidiCtrlVal{int val, Part* part}, and changed class MidiCtrlValList from
           std::map<int, int>  to  std::multimap<int, MidiCtrlVal>
          Changed MidiCtrlValList::add(int tick, int value) to MidiCtrlValList::add(int tick, int value, Part* part),
           and MidiCtrlValList::del(int tick) to MidiCtrlValList::del(int tick, Part* part),
           and added MidiCtrlValList::find(int tick, Part* part).
          Changed Song::addEvent(), Song::changeEvent(), Song::deleteEvent(), Song::addPart(), Song::changePart(), 
           Song::removePart(), Song::insertTrack2(), and Song::removeTrack2() to make sure port controller values 
           are added/removed properly.
          Changed a few other things to make it all work. 
          Reasons: The Part* member was added to each controller value item in the list, so that the system can 
           know exactly which part was responsible for putting a value in the list.
          This helps when we have overlapping controller values from events of different parts on the same port and the same channel - 
           if one of the parts is deleted or moved, the overlapping values from the events of the other part are NOT disturbed
           within the port's controller value list. 
          The list was changed from 'map' to 'multimap' to accommodate the multiple values from events of different parts.
         - NOTE: When there are overlapping values from events of different parts, the system will arbitrarily choose the
           first value it finds at a given time. I considered 'mixing' the overlapping values together
           (by averaging, or maybe highest/lowest value), but I felt it would just cause more confusion for the user.
          Therefore it is up to the user to be aware of overlapping controller events and deal with them.
          If you are looking at a controller graph and it shows a particular value at some time, but the 
           midi knobs/sliders and actual midi output does NOT correspond to what you are seeing, then 
           most likely ANOTHER part on the same port and channel has an event at that same time, and that 
           event's value is likely the one that is being used by the system.
      * Fixed: Changing a midi track's out port or channel was not updating the ports' controller values. (T356)
        - Changed MidiTrack::setOutPort() and MidiTrack::setOutChannel() calls to new MidiTrack::setOutPortAndUpdate() 
           and MidiTrack::setOutChanAndUpdate(), which make sure the port's controller value list is properly updated.
        - Part of the larger fixes above.   
      * Fixed: Midi adjustment knob on controller canvas was not working after moving the part to another track. (T356)
        - Added some code to CtrlCanvas::songChanged() to set curPart and curTrack and update the knob,
           upon SC_PART_MODIFIED.
      * Fixed: Clear midi input transforms when song cleared. Update transform dialog when song changed. (T356)
        - Symptom: Repeated loading of songs causes duplication of midi transforms, causing .med song files to grow big !
        - Added clearMidiInputTransforms() to midiitransform.cpp, called by Song::clear().
        - Added updatePresetList() and slot songChanged() to MidiInputTransformDialog, triggered by Song::songChanged.
        - Added some code to readMidiInputTransform() to **auto-eliminate** duplicate transforms in existing .med files.
        - Still some 'quirkiness' with the dialog buttons, but it works better now.
        - ALSO: Applied those same fixes to midi transforms and the midi transform dialog.
      * Fixed: Notes not recorded to track for a drum map 'instrument item' having non-default (track) port. (T356)
        - Changed to drumRecEvent.setPort(port) in 'Track::DRUM' section of 'if(recording)' section of Audio::processMidi()
           so that buildMidiEventList() would accept the notes.
      * Fixed: Removed jack midi port names from audio in/out port lists. (T356)
        - Added JACK_DEFAULT_AUDIO_TYPE to jack_get_ports calls in JackAudioDevice::inputPorts and ::outputPorts.
      * Fixed: Notes were being mixed up when switching a track type between midi and drum. (T356)
        - Changed to drumMap[pitch].enote in 'Drum -> Midi' section of TList::classesPopupMenu().
      * Completed: Moving multiple events from multiple parts when editing in pianoroll or drum editor. (T356)
        - Work had begun several commits ago. Completed.
        - Now you can select and move multiple events from different parts in the editors.
      * Feature: When editing multiple parts in the pianoroll or drum editor, controller graphs are now overlaid! (T356)
        - When you are editing more than one part at a time in the editors, the controller graph will overlay
           all of the graphs together!
        - The currently selected part will show its controller as normal blue columns, as before, but the other 
           unselected parts will draw their controllers as a gray 'ghost' outline on top.
        - TODO: Add menu items, hot keys etc. to cycle through each part (in case there are no notes to select in a part!)
      * Improved: Support for GS/XG midi drum controllers. (T356)
        - Added MidiPort::drumController(). Tells if an event is a drum controller event, according to the port's instrument.
          Does it by looking up the event in the instrument's controller list.
          Would prefer a 'marker flag', eg use the event 'dataA' high bit to mark as drum controller event, but it's too risky!
          Used MidiPort::drumController() a dozen or so places where drum controller events needed remapping/manipulation etc.
          May be a speed hit with many/large controller graphs? Test further...
        - Added code to update port controller values when changing drum map ANote, channel, or port.
        - KNOWN BUGS: Still a few loose ends to tie up: Port controller values (but not track events) may not be correct when: 
           'Swapping' (by dragging) items in the drum map, and
           loading a song with a drum map which had 'swapped' (by dragging) items.
          Some stuff (midi value adjustment knob) is not updated when changing drum map ANote, channel, or port. 
          Workaround: Be sure to select another drum map item, then reselect the changed item again, after such operations.
      * Changed: All softsynth midi controllers now have default initial values. (T356)
        - Added default initial values to all softsynth controllers such as fluidsynth's controller map.
        - Added 'initval' argument to all ::getControllerInfo() methods, which is passed to the newly created 
           controller (new MidiController) in SynthI::initInstance().
        - These initial values will then show on the various gui midi adjustment controls, knobs etc.
      * Changed: Fluidsynth master gain and reverb initial settings. Gain was too loud and there was too much reverb. (T356)
      * Fixed: Follow up - some issues with instrument editor. (T356)
        - Instrument editor was sometimes falsely detecting instrument had changed. 
        - Also, do not list 'internal' instruments like generic midi, soft synths, vst etc.
        - Also, upon 'Save As', prompt for a new instrument name if the user hasn't changed it, to avoid duplicates.
        - Remove any unsaved (new) instrument when moving to another instrument, closing etc.
        - Fixed up tab order of instrument editor controls.
        - TODO: When muse wants to close, trap it in the instrument editor so we can save.
      * Fixed: Problem in xml parser. '&amp', '&quot' etc were being read as '&&', '""' etc. (T356)
        - Added a couple of lines, and removed one, in Xml::stoken().
      * Fixed: Zero bias midi controllers (with a negative minimum value, like 'pan') weren't working right. (T356)
        - Broken after last changes. Added an updateBias() line to MidiController::read() 'controller' tag end section.
      * Added: Send all instrument controller initial (default) values to all of a port's midi channels, 
           except where explicitly initialized by the song. (T356)
        - Added some code to MidiPort::setMidiDevice to initialize controllers from instrument, if needed.
        - When setting a midi port's device (such as in Settings->Midi Ports, or simply when loading a song),
           then any specified controller initial values in the instrument are sent to ALL of the port's channels, 
           EVEN if the controller is NOT in the song. This ensures better consistency between songs, so that 
           chosen controllers are not left in undesirable 'leftover' states. 
          (Taken from important comments in MidiPort::setMidiDevice(): )
          For example: A song is loaded which has a 'reverb level' controller initial value of '100'.
          Then a song is loaded which has no such controller (hence no explicit initial value).
          The 'reverb level' controller would still be at '100', and could adversely affect the song,
           but if the instrument has an available initial value of say '0', it will be used instead.
        - It is desirable to have defaults for some controllers, but it is wise to have NO default for certain 
           other controllers, like the 'reset all controllers' and 'sustain' controllers (actually, zero would be OK).
      * Changed: Clicking Midi->InitInstrument (or moving to song position 0) now initializes controllers
          from instrument controller initial values, if they exist, or previously hard coded values if not. (T356)
        - sendGmOn() and sendXgOn(), which are called via Audio::initDevices(), now use instrument controller
           initial values if they exist, or the previously hard coded values if not.
      * Changed: Non-softsynth non-GM drum tracks: Patch popups now show all drum AND melodic patches on ANY channel. (T356)
        - For drum tracks, if the song type is not GM, and the track's port is not a softsynth, then all patches
           including drum AND melodic are shown for ALL channels when 'select instrument patch' popup is clicked,
           regardless of the patches' 'drum' flag setting (in the instrument editor). 
           (Softsynths handle their own patch popup lists).
        - Added a 'bool isDrum' parameter to all populatePatchPopup() methods, which is passed 'true' only
           if it's a drum track, and changed a couple of lines in the only class which uses the drum flag - MidiInstrument.
        - Previous behaviour was to show drum patches ONLY on channel 10 of drum tracks. 
        - Reasons for change: 1): A midi device might have a non-standard drum channel(s), so drum patches 
           as well as melodic patches are shown for all channels. 2): Since any channel can be used in the drum map,
           melodic patches are shown as well as drum patches so that any patch can be selected for any channel.
          NOTE: Each of a drum track's channels which are used in the drum map should be set to a patch number, 
           otherwise it doesn't work right ! (**) This is true for softsynth devices too ! (**). 
          So it was imperative that the user be able to select ANY patch on ANY channel, to suit their setup, 
           for flexibility.
          (If that same flexibility were applied to regular midi tracks (non-drum tracks), it might make the
           'drum' flag for patches obsolete, since there would be no reason to filter them from the list !)
      * Changed: All midi controller event values sent to a midi port are now constrained (limited) to the port's
          instrument controller's range (if that instrument controller exists). (T356)
        - Example: Incoming events from a midi keyboard's pitch wheel range from -8192 to 8191, but it is
           desired to limit that range to, say -200 to 8191. One could use the midi input transformer to
           accomplish this, but instead now you can simply adjust the chosen instrument's pitch controller range
           (in the instrument editor), and then the pitch wheel's range will be limited to that range.
        - This only affects playback events (and therefore 'live' incoming events), but does NOT affect
           actual recorded data, so that by simply readjusting the instrument controller's range, 
           or by changing instruments, the range can be restored with no loss of recorded data range.
      * Fixed: Cleaned up all .idf files and changed ranges of all 'zero-bias' controls (-64/63 'pan' etc). (T356)
        - Many .idf files had bare '&' characters in them, causing corruption of names and values when reading.
        - Also turned on the 'drum' flag for ALL drum patches in MANY .idf instrument files.
          Some .idf's I was uncertain about, and did not change : AlesisQS6, Waldorf Q.
      * Changed: Fluidsynth pan controller range from 0/127 to -64/63. (T356)
        - To be consistent with .idf file changes.
      * Replaced: All direct calls to MidiPort::setHwCtrlState() from GUI thread, with new Audio::msgSetHwCtrlState(). (T356)
        - My fault, I was not paying attention to iter-thread communications.
      * Optimizations: Optimized MidiPort::setHwCtrlState(), MidiPort::sendEvent(), and calls to MidiPort::setCtrl(). (T356)
        - Optimized MidiPort::sendEvent().
        - Replaced code in MidiPort::setHwCtrlState() with more optimized code.
        - Replaced several clumsy calls to MidiPort::setCtrl(), which checked for and created the controller,
           with a new optimized MidiPort::setControllerVal(). 
06.01.2009
      * Fixed simpledrums/ssplugin.cpp to build with recent Ubuntu 8.10 (FN)
17.08.2008
      * Feature: Muse now has an instrument editor, complete with a midi controller editor! (T356)
        - Click on the menu "Midi->Edit Instrument".
        - You will see a sysex editor there too, but it is non-functional. (Use the midi event editor instead).
        - >>> Tooltips and "What's This?" are provided with IMPORTANT information. <<<
          >>> If you want to understand how to use instruments, patches, and controllers in your song, <<< 
          >>>    READ THEM!    <<<
      * Added: Environment variable MUSEINSTRUMENTS, so a (writable) instrument directory can be chosen
         instead of default /usr/share/muse/instruments etc. (T356)
        - Also added display of environment variables recognized by muse to command line help (muse -h).
      * Fixed: Popup displays of instrument patches to filter according to GM, GS, XG song type, and whether
         on drum channel 10. (T356)
        - Use the new instrument editor to set these GM, GS, XG, and drum filters.
      * Changed slightly: Creation of a new drum track - initialize to channel 10 instead of 1. (T356) 
      * Fixed: Force audio prefetch seek when play is pressed. (T356)
        - In Audio::seek, changed the call of audioPrefetch->msgSeek to force a prefetch,
           to ensure the most recent data. Things can happen to a part before play is pressed  
           such as part muting, part moving etc. Without a force, the wrong (old) data was being played.
        - If you perform those same operations while playing, there may be a few seconds delay before you
           hear the changes (the play cursor must move a certain distance before they're heard).
        - TODO: How to make the same thing happen when transport is externally started, such as from qjackctl.
            OR: How to force a prefetch at specific places like when a part is muted, and when it is moved,
                 instead of just before play is started. That way the operations can be done quickly while playing.
      * Fixed hangup: Upon loading of songs with fluidsynth soundfonts which can't be found. (T356)
        - (!) Removed error message box from FluidSynthGUI::processEvent causing freezeup.
        - You can still read fluidsynth errors by running muse on a command line. I figured it was 
           better to be able to load the song and to see errors, instead of just letting it freeze.
        - This should now allow you to share fluidsynth songs with other people (without the soundfonts).
      * Fixed: Audio aux tracks not working, intermittent. (T356)
        - Aux functionality was intermittent depending on whether the aux had out routes,
           and whether any tracks feeding the aux had out routes, and other factors.
        - In Audio::process1, rearranged, and added, some code to make aux work all the time now.   
      * Speedups: To some songChanged() functions. Ignore unnecessary flags. (T356)
        - For example simply adjusting midi gui controls would cause costly and
           unnecessary rebuilding/redrawing of certain areas, like parts of trackinfo, and controller graphs.
        - Noticeably less 'slugglish' when adjusting controls now.
      * Fixed: Midi controller events not being added to midi port controller, after record with no part. (T356)
        - Symptom: If you record midi controllers without first creating a part, muse creates the part 
           for you and creates the controller graph OK, but when you move the play cursor around, the graphs
           have no effect. This doesn't happen if you first create the part to record into, or manually edit a graph.
        - Symptom: As above, the graph is OK, but the controllers don't show up in the list when you click 'ctrl'.
        - Changed a line in song::cmdAddRecordedEvents() to use addEvent() instead of adding directly to list.
      * Fixed: Automatic detection of pitch bend wheel not working. (T356)
        - Added some code to MidiPort::sendEvent to detect ME_PITCHBEND events.
        - Note: There appears to be a sound system bug (using ALSA 1.0.15): The system will NOT deliver any pitch 
           bend events to muse until ANOTHER controller is detected, ex. move the modulation wheel THEN the pitch wheel.
          Verified with another app - RG - and with a real midi hardware to hardware connection (not my KB's fault).
      * Observed: Stuck or missing midi notes when recording or even just 'record armed only' 'live' playing. (T356)
        - The sound system appears to be having occasional trouble detecting midi events, including note-off ! 
          Verified with muse and RG (using ALSA 1.0.15). Not sure why or when this started, seems early this year...
      * Linked: All midi knobs and sliders with their labels. (T356)
        - Now they work together when displaying and adjusting.
        - After careful consideration of the meaning of 'off' in those
          labels, you now double click the label to turn the midi control on/off.
          Off does not mean 'zero'. Rather, it means:
          'Don't save this current value in the song file'.
          When a midi control is 'off', loading the song won't initialize the controller with a value.
          'Off' means the current value is set at 'unknown'. 'Unknown' means the actual 
           'behind the scenes' hardware value is the last value that was set. The knob or slider still 
           shows this value, or a default initial value, or if both of those are unknown, then 0.
      * Changed: Midi and audio level slider/knob labels to show '---' for infinite attenuation. (T356)
        - As mentioned above, the midi level slider labels can also show 'off'.
      * Fixed: The new midi controller knob in pianoroll and drum editor. (T356)
        - It was not adjusting anything.
      * Fixed: Midi vu meters again. Now they should work! (T356)
        - They were not responding to play events with an off velocity other than zero.
      * Fixed: Marker view window doesn't remember if it is open or closed. (T356)
        - Add a markerClosed function to app.
      * Reverted: Back to audioRTalloc in mpevent.h (T356)
        (!) - I had changed it to midiRTalloc, but that may have been causing problems like 
               midi shutdown (audio OK) after a few hours, and crash soon afterwards. 
              Verifying... No more midi shutdowns after a few hours, so far...
            Ooops, not so fast, happened again...
30.04.2008
      * Fixed bug in drum editor. Dragging the splitter too far left causes runaway resize, stuck in loop. (T356)
        - Tried several different arrangements, but QSplitter won't behave the way I need it to. Best I could do, so far. 
        - You may notice some strangeness, like the controller graph not aligning with the matrix, if the right edge 
           of the window is offscreen.
      * Added 'add/set event' to audio automation right-click popup menus. Ancient request by R.J. (T356)
      * Fixed arranger midi strip and arranger top controls not giving up keyboard focus after adjustment/entry. (T356)
        - Further request by user G.B. Changed all relevant QSpinBoxes to custom SpinBox, which behaves like this:
           Click up/down, or mousewheel, or hit enter with un-modified text (which means enter TWICE for modified text), 
            and the control will give up focus, thereby allowing you to use global shortcut keys afterwards. 
            Up/down keys still keep the focus.
        - TODO: Piano roll and drum editor.
      * Fixed major problem with lost jack routes upon file save, when save causes a jack shutdown. (T356)
        - Symptom: You click save, but jack shuts down during the save, causing lost jack routes in the file.
        - Fix: Cached the jack route names before file save, then used them during AudioTrack::writeRouting() xml code.
          Note this doesn't actually stop shutdowns from happening - now it just saves your files without losing jack routes.
      * Fixed mysterious intermittent wave part muting, as mentioned in 11.03.2008 (T356)
        - !!! PartList and EventList are now sorted by frame instead of tick, for wave parts only. Because fetchData() 
           didn't like sorting by ticks. This is a radical change. So far, no other areas found requiring further coding, but...
      * Overlapping wave parts and events now mix together, instead of one part or event taking priority over others ! (T356)
        - Virtually no speed hit, since muse was already cycling through all the wave parts/events, 
           just not mixing them together. So the very LAST wave part/event in the part/event lists was 
           taking priority over others.
      * Fixed default instrument midi controller min/max values. (T356)
        - Symptom: Some pianoroll midi controller graphs much too small or too big, vertically.
        - Cause: You added these controllers to your track as a midi instrument, ex. General Midi (GM), then you 
           changed the instrument, ex. to 'Generic Midi' or another instrument without those controllers,
           which set improper min/max values.
        - Fix: Added code to MidiPort::midiController() to set proper min/max values based on standard controller type.
          However, if the original instrument used CUSTOM min/max values, the graph may still be distorted.
      * Fixes to midi event list editor. (T356)
        - Added true sorting of event list. Now you can click on column headers to sort as desired! 
        - Added formatted program number display (like 1-1-120) for 'Val B' column.
        - Fixed Poly After Touch events display in list. They were being listed as Channel After Touch.
        - Fixed crash when 'Delete events' clicked with no actual items selected.
        - 'Edit Contoller Event' dialog:
          - Fixed 'Create New Controller' popup list: Now it actually creates the selected controller.
          - Fixed 'Program' controller not showing correct program after selecting other controllers in list.
          - Fixed too high initial value displayed for controllers without an initial value in the instrument file.
        - 'Enter Poly After Touch' dialog:
          - Fixed uneditable note box. Switched from PitchLabel to PitchEdit. 
      * Feature added - Pianoroll and drum editor controller graphs now have a static manual adjustment knob ! (T356)
        - Now you don't have to enter controller graph values to adjust a setting, just turn the knob.
      * Changed 'Create New Controller' in event editor 'Edit Contoller Event' dialog, and 'add new...' controller popup 
         list in piano roll. (T356)
        - Now they only list controllers not already added, instead of all of them. 
      * Fixed 'Position Edit' controls (0001.01.000 + up/down buttons) - click 'down' nothing happens. (T356)
        - Added updateButtons() call to PosEdit::setValue(). 
      * Fixed Mixer midi strip variation, reverb and chorus send knobs not enabled after controllers added. (T356)
        - Now you only need to create the controller to enable the knobs, allowing you to set a manual value without  
           having to actually create one or more controller events first.
      * Fixed midi trackinfo pan value not the same as midi mixer strip pan value. (T356)
        - Trackinfo pan now goes from 'off' (-65) to -64 to +63.
      * Fixes to fluidsynth. Would crash when getting patch names from an 'unspecified' soundfont. (T356)
        - In fluidsynti.cpp, various places check for FS_UNSPECIFIED_FONT only. Added check for FS_UNSPECIFIED_ID.
        - Not sure if FS_UNSPECIFIED_FONT is redundant and unnecessary, but left it there anyway.
      * Fixed old bug - IntLabel control - right click causes popup and runaway increment. (T356)
        - Fixed NEntry widget. Same fix as for double entry widget (DEntry), somewhere way down on this change log...
      * More fixes to wave part gluing/splitting/drawing/playing. (T356)
        - Now all splitting/gluing of wave parts, even overlapping ones, even multiple times, should work.
        - Fixed problem in WaveTrack::fetchData causing it to read too many samples of wave events.
      * Fixes and changes to bounce functions. (T356)
        - Fixed garbled target track or file. processWrite() was writing ALL the Audio Outputs to the file or track, instead of just one.
        - Feature: Bounce to track (from menu): You now first select any single Audio Output track, and any single target Wave track.
        - Feature: Bounce to file (from menu): You now first select any single Audio Output track.
      * Fixed some problems with Mastertrack window. (T356)
        - Mastertrack window was causing tempos to be inserted into tempo list, if window open when project loaded.
        - Added signature list change event handling - to update signature value box.
        - Fixed drawing of signature scale after signature list change.
      * Fixed wave editor 'reverse' function crashing. (T356)
      * Fixed track list not highlighting wave tracks (default green) when selected in the arranger window. (T356)
      * Fixed midi VU meters, again. (T356)
        - Borrowed idea from Muse 2. Self-decay the meters in midi strip code, rather than the midi thread code.
        - The midi VU meters self-decay at a rate determined by the GUI update rate in the configuration.
11.03.2008
      * Fixed arranger controls not giving up keyboard focus after adjustment/entry. Requested by user G.B. (T356)
      * Fixed gluing/splitting of waveparts. (Known bug of 02.02.2008 is gone now). (T356)
      * Fixed playing, and arranger/waveeditor drawing, of glued waveparts. (T356)
        - 'Working on' of 26.01.2008 is done.
        - Drawing of waveparts, even 'glued' ones, now fully respects tempo changes.
      * Fixed 'glued' mono + stereo wavepart drawing. Was drawing outside track if track height small. (T356)
      * Fixed soloed/muted wavetrack audio 'bleeding' into other wavetracks. fetchData() was not checking isMute(). (T356)
      * Fixed part colour popup to change unselected clicked item colour if no parts selected. (T356)
      * Fixed recent possible accidental(?) change of tracklist xml tag 'header' to 'header1'. (T356)
        - Muse was complaining: Tlist: unknown tag <header> at line 32
      * Fixed MREventList in mpevent.h, to use midiRTalloc instead of audioRTalloc. (T356)
        - Possible accidental(?) coding error since there is no other usage of midiRTalloc at all in muse.
        - If it does help at all, it might just ease RT congestion a bit.
      * Working on MIDI VU meters. They're too fast to see with jack, but should be OK with dummy driver. (T356)
      * KNOWN PREEXISTING BUGS
        - If you move waveparts around AFTER the current play position, then play, muse actually plays the same
           arrangement as if you had not moved the waveparts at all, just one time - rewind the play position and
           it corrects itself. This is because muse does not prefetch the audio again after the movement of the parts.
          Workaround - After moving waveparts, be sure to rewind the play position to a point AT LEAST before those parts.
        - Wave parts will sometimes mysteriously go silent for no reason. Move the parts slightly, or reload, or do
           certain other operations, then the sound comes back. Working on this important issue!  
02.02.2008
      * Fixed a slight error in BigTime absolute display. Now shows proper absolute tick and frame values. (T356)
      * Added an extra arranger wavepart right-click popup menu item - "file info". 
        Shows what wave file(s) are used by the wavepart event(s). 
        TODO: Either remove duplicate file names or list the files by event number. 
              Spice up with more info like wave starting/ending points etc.             (T356)
      * Removed some debug output lines from dummy driver - may have been causing intermittent crashes when moving position. (T356)
      * Some more fixes to arranger partcanvas wavepart drawing - speeded up and tightened code.
        KNOWN BUG: Does not correctly display more than one wave 'event' (file) per wavepart. (For ex. two waveparts 'glued' together).
                   Working on this issue ! (T356)
27.01.2008
      * Fixed MIDI mixer strip VU meters. Let there be light! Not the best solution, a choice between two so-so methods. 
        Looking at how to improve it... (T356)
26.01.2008
      * Pianoroll and drumedit now open at the current cursor position. (T356)
        (The cursor position is that moving black vertical line on the time scale). 
        This means you just click on an arranger midi part where you want to open the editor.
      * Arranger, pianoroll, drumedit and waveedit now stay at their current (left-side) position when you use the scale bar. (T356)
      * Fixed 'end of part' drawing problems - now you are guaranteed to see about 1+1/4 extra bar after the end 
         of a pianoroll/drumedit (also compensating for drumedit drummap/canvas splitter), allowing you to 
         add/move/clone notes past the end and allowing muse to properly auto-extend the part (to the right).  
        TODO: Auto-extend parts to the left when necessary. (T356)
      * Added vertical, and fixed horizontal, lasso/parts/events auto-scroll - even past the end of parts.  (T356)
      * Fixed drawing of wave parts in arranger. Now you can rely on the 'picture' of the wave inside the part 
         lining up correctly with the time scale, regardless of tempo/timesig changes in the song. (T356)
      * More fixes to wave editor. Fixed drawing of markers - they were much too close together.
        Added songChanged synchronization with arranger (you move/resize a wave part and the wave editor readjusts, etc.)
        WORKING ON: In the arranger, if you move a wave part to the left, the wave editor will readjust but the
         wave may be chopped off at the end. Investigating...  (T356)
      * Corrected the drawing order of items from ALL parts in pianoroll and drumedit. For multiple-part viewing.
        WORK IN PROGRESS: Added ability to select items from different parts at once, and to move them. 
                          For now, only items from the currently selected part actually move. (T356)
      * Added small checkbox to Big Time display. Now you can switch between formatted or absolute time display.
        Absolute is handy for syncing with another app, or just knowing, absolutely, where you are in the song. Absolutely.
        Added ToolTip popups describing each 'group' of numbers (bars, beats, ticks etc). (T356)
20.01.2008
      (ml)
      * Added function for deleting note overlaps in piano roll (usually makes fluidsynth grumpy - silencing the following note). 
      * Some work on opening the editor at current position and selecting the leftmost item
      (ws)
      * fixed hanging note when editing multiple parts in midieditor and
        switching part
19.01.2008 (ws)
      * fixed Song::changeEvent(): part tick offset was not used
      * fixed removing of controller events in Song::deleteEvent(); this affects midi recording
        in replace mode and controller editing
12.10
      * Fixed automation right-click popup menu 'prev/next event' not working after a tempo change. (T356)
        - Now you are guaranteed to be able to navigate the automation events, regardless
           of how many tempo or time signature changes are in the song, or if you change the tempo/sig(s)
           AFTER adding automation events.
12.06
      * Fixed softsynths 'Fluidsynth', 'Deicsonze', and 'Fluid' to allow pitch wheel changes. (T356)
      * Fixed softsynths 'Fluidsynth' and 'Deicsonze' to allow MIDI patch changes. (T356)
        Note that I included MIDI patch change code in 'Fluid', but fluid is slightly broken
         and still doesn't respond. 'Fluid' should be removed from muse. It's obsolete. Use Fluidsynth.
11.22
      * Fixed LASH loading and saving. (T356)
        - Symptom - Muse fails building with error about 'lash_get_fqn' not declared in scope.
        - Cause - You are building muse with LASH > 0.5.1, where certain header files have been removed.
        - Fix - Replaced both calls to lash_get_fqn with QString manipulations instead.
      * NOTE! I encountered a muse segfault when you use LASH to close the project.
        It says 'received unknown LASH event of type 10' (which is LASH_Server_Lost), then it says
         'received unknown LASH event of type <<some big random number>>, then segfault and
         a glibc backtrace due to 'double free or corruption'. Not a big deal, but this will need to be fixed.
      * Tested OK saving and loading projects with LASH 0.5.4

      =======================================

08.20
      * Fixed bug 1650953 - select and move segfault  (T356)
        - Symptom - In piano roll, select some notes and move them past the end of the part,
          then muse crashes. Also occurs when pasting or adding notes past part length.
        - Cause - Canvas was not adding the new resized part to the midi editor. Also a bunch
          of other stuff needed to be fixed for it all to work OK.
      * Fixed broken master list editor. Should also cure bug 1687166 (T356)
        - Symptom - Open master list and nothing is listed (should be at least one default
          tempo and one default time signature). Click to add new tempo or sig and muse crashes.
        - Cause - Some code was added to lmaster.cpp: LMaster::updateList() which broke it.
      * Added auto part resizing to drum canvas  (T356)
        - Symptom - In drums editor, there is no auto part resizing, like in piano roll.
        - Cause - Missing all part resizing code. Added.
      * Fixed intermittent crash when cutting a part. Improper 'delete while iterate' STL operation. (T356)
      * Fixed arranger part selection - selected parts now draw on top of non-selected parts. (T356)
      * Fixed arranger part operations (move etc.) to use selected part. (T356)
      * Fixed arranger keyboard left and right previous/next part selection. (T356)
        - Now you can use left/right arrow keys to cycle through parts in a track,
           expecially useful for overlapping parts!
      * Regarding part selection - A remaining problem is that there is no 'z-order' drawing
         scheme. The part item list has no such ordering support.
        - This means a selected part will (now) appear on top of others, but when unselected,
           it will not stay on top. Adding that support could be messy.
        - Best to leave it alone for now. At least you can (now) cycle through overlapped parts...
      * Tested arranger part operations with worst case scenario - multiple tempo changes
         and multiple parts. Test OK. All should be OK now. (T356)
      * Added tooltip to song length box in arranger with text 'song length in bars'. (T356)
      * Fixed wave editor - Black selection bar intermittent drawing. (T356)
        - Symptom - In wave editor selecting a portion of the wave caused intermittent drawing
          of the black selection bar.
        - Cause - Unsure of exact cause or a permanent cure, but it's better now.
          But it still draws intermittently if you zoom in (x magnify) very very close.
          Working on this issue.
      * Added feature - Wave editor now allows you to open multiple selected wave parts and
         will display only those parts and you can edit them. Tested wave editor 'functions'
         menu and it works OK on some or all selected portions of the multiple wave parts.
        - This is in preparation for a possible automation viewer and/or editor.
        - Work in progress. Some rough parts still to clean up. (T356)
      * Fixed intermittent arithmetic exception crash in wave viewer. (T356)
      * Fixed bad wave drawing above certain zoom level in wave editor. (T356)
      * Enabled serial numbers in my deltaTick2Frame and deltaFrame2Tick routines, and
         merged code. Makes it a bit faster. (T356)
=======
08.16 * Reverted change in synth.cpp, realtime playback of softsynths did not work (rj)
      * fix for sustain pedal to work as suspected when looping. (rj)

        time will tell if this is the right solution (rj)
02.13

2007.01.03
      * Fixed some major issues with undo/redo. (T356)
        - Symptom - Delete track(s), then undo, muse crashes.
        - Symptom - Rename a track, then undo, muse crashes.
        - Cause - 'Delete' destroyed the track(s), so undo would attempt to restore
          non-existent object. Other problems caused rename crash. Still more undo/redo code
          was causing problems, like left-over synth instances hanging around after loading a new song,
          or crashing upon loading a new song if certain redo items were still in the redo list...
        - Known bugs - DON'T rename a synth track then undo, muse still crashes. Not sure why yet.
          After 'un-deleting' a synth track, you will have to open the 'MIDI Ports/Soft Synth' window
          and manually restore its MIDI port.
          Don't do anything too crazy like deleting multiple tracks while playing, might possibly crash.
          After undeleting an audio wave track, its sound might not be sync'd with the rest of the song -
          simply hit the fast-forward or rewind button to cure that.
      * Prevented saving, and segfault upon loading, of routes in med file with empty names. (T356)
        - Symptom - Jack shuts down, so instead of attempting to restart audio, you save your work,
          but when you try to reload your song, muse crashes.
        - Cause - Upon Jack shutdown, all audio in and out Jack routes were erased, and muse saved
          the song like that. Upon reload, muse would crash due to the empty routes in the .med file.
        - Note that this does not cure the original cause of this (Jack routes erased), so although you
          can now re-load the song without muse crashing, you must manually restore all the audio in/out
          Jack routes. So please try to restart the audio first. (Trying to fix this issue...)
      * Add new soloing system. Check it out! (T356)
        - Symptom - You click solo on a track but you hear nothing, and all other tracks are muted.
        - Cause - Wasn't really broken, you just had to solo all other tracks in that routing path
          to make sure whatever you were attempting to solo made its way to its destination so you
          would hear it.
          Inconvenient, yes. Especially with a large song with a lot of tracks, groups etc.
          With this new system, this is done automatically for you. Even MIDI tracks driving synth
          tracks, too.
        - Known bug - If a MIDI track drives some external MIDI device which you feed the audio
          back into muse, there's no way for muse to know how to couple the MIDI and audio in
          tracks together. Sorry you'll have to manually solo both.
          BUT - I'm CONSIDERING adding this - If an audio in track's name BEGINS WITH the name
          of a MIDI track, I could couple them that way. For example - MIDI track named 'Track1' and
          an audio in track named 'Track1 Input', then muse could mutually solo both tracks properly...
      * Enabled MIDI mixer strip solo buttons. (T356)
      * Some other minor fixups here and there. (T356)
        - Other known bugs - Due to an earlier oversight, if you use your own custom LADSPA plugin
          GUI's (see README.ladspaguis), QCheckbox and QCombobox controls may not automate quite right.
          Note that this includes just one built-in custom GUI - for the 'TAP Reverberator' plugin.
21.11
      * Fixed loading of .med files, with plugins, created before muse-0.9pre1. (t356)
        They will load, then save, correctly now.
        - Symptom - Load an old song with plugins and some of the plugin controls can't be moved.
        - Cause - Controller id's in med file mixed up, not save correctly, because of moving rack
          plugins around, which never properly switched the id's before muse-0.9pre1.
      * Fixed soloing (again). (t356)
        - Symptom - Delete a soloed track, then soloing is messed up - other tracks may be muted but don't show it,
          only way out is to reload. Speaking of which, loading also did not set track soloing correctly.
        - Cause - Upon deleting a track or loading a song, track solo ref count was not updated.
      * Added infrastructure for an improved soloing system, much more intuitive. (Not done yet!...) (t356)
      * Fixed spelling mistake - Freeverb "Rooom" size. (t356)
13.11
      * By T356
      * More automation fixes. Everything should be working now, check it out!
      * Although still no automation editor, all of these changes so far should help
         manipulate and navigate the events.
      * Fixed touch mode events storing, was not right.
      * Fixed a couple of stray signal connects which may have caused wacky controls.
      * Sliders, knobs and labels now respond to mousewheel and paging properly.
      * Linked slider/knob labels with sliders and knobs so paging or mousewheeling
         a label works smoothly and linearly, even with logarithmic controls.
      * Fixed integer controls (like Glame Bandpass 'stages').
      * Fixed external plugin gui's to look like the built-in freeverb. This means
         they now scale properly with different fonts. :)
      * Hopefully the last of major automation conceptual changes - making sliders, knobs,
         labels and checkboxes work together with the four automation modes, barring any fixes,
         and a few tweaks to follow (like shift key for label mousewheeling, and how to make
         a label stop updating so values can be entered). Some more right-click menu options
         may follow (like store event, enable automation, enable interpolation).
         Automation readme to come (need it!).
      * Still to fix - Controls' right-click automation menu still a bit confused upon tempo changes.
10.11
      * reworked mute, old solution caused problems for solo
      * solo is now united between midi and audio, they were previously
        interdependant. This has the downside that if a soft synth is
        soloed both the midi and the audio needs to have solo enabled (rj)
      * fixed issue with hanging notes for softsynths when stop is pressed (rj)
      * Backported fix from HEAD for using a file descriptor from two different
        threads, should make it work somewhat better with SMP (rj)
      * fixed faulty off value for aux when set to max (rj)
      * Allow wheeling of tracks from track list (rj)
08.11
      * reenabled mute for outputs (rj)
07.11
      * Fixed timing bug causing MusE to depend on jack buffer setting
        this needs testing, it involved uncommenting some code that might
        have been commented for a reason (rj)
05.11
      * Added support for auto-scroll for other drag operations but
      rubberband (rj)
04.11
      =======================================
      * 0.9pre1 tagged (rj)
      =======================================
04.11
      * Adopted RT locking method from 1.0 branch. (rj)
      * Preparations for 0.9pre1 (rj)
31.10
      * By T356
      * Fixed old bug - DoubleLabel right click causes popup and runaway increment.
      * Currently the increment/decrement is fixed at 1, so that's why it doesn't
         work for pan or other controls with 1.0 or less max.
        - So fixes to that are next...
29.10
      * By T356
      * Changing global tempo now updates things. (Like resizing wave tracks).
      * Fixed segfault upon lengthening a blank new wave track part.
      * Removed some thread-unsafe code from my first patch
      * Fixed ladspa plugin automation not working until plugin displayed.
      * Improved automation and ladspa plugin automation behaviour.
        - While stopped and in touch mode, clicking an automateable control immediately
           writes the value to the list, so you don't have to press play then stop
           just to store one value.
        - Smoother slider transitions from last touched value to previous stored values,
           so that they don't suddenly 'jump' to previous stored values when you let go.
        - Checkboxes now automated. Their behaviour in touch mode is slightly
           different than sliders - they remain 'touched' until you stop, but store
           only up to the last toggle done.
        - Checkboxes now check as soon as you click them.
        - Sliders now have 'mouse cursor capture (tm)' so you can actually grab onto
           the thumbs even if they are moving too quickly due to automation. Paging can
           still be done with right button.
        - Sliders and knobs now work properly if you 'page' them (click outside the thumb
           or dial).
        - Added right-click popup menu on all automateable controls with
            previous event    (seek)
            next event        (seek)
            erase event       (if cursor is on one)
            erase range       (between left and right markers)
            clear automation  (clear all events)
          Known bug: Becomes slightly confused if tempo is changed after doing automation.
          Workaround for now: Press play to update the cursor to a new position.
04.10
      * Select the right item when items are stacked on top of each other, for pianoroll
        and arranger (rj)
      * Do not display resize cursor when last track cannot be resized (rj)
03.10
      * Apply effect rack before sending aux, changed after discussion with Thorsten Wilms (rj)
      * Auto assign internal softsynths upon creation (rj)
      * New method for pasting parts. If several parts are pasted they are now spaced
        according to their original spacing. This only works reliably when the copied parts
        are all on one track. (Possibly copying parts from several tracks should be
        disallowed), fixes bug #1516294 (rj)
      * Muting of midi-tracks no longer mute input, bug #1092343 (rj)
01.10
      * Fixed issue with playing of controllers when moving playhead. basically
        all events from all parts where played at the beginning, fixes bug #1316542 (rj)
30.09
      * Cached peak files are now updated when wave files are more recent, bug #1469177(rj)
      * Fixed bug with recording notes to existing part, bug #1552783 (rj)
29.09
      * MusE now asks when imported wave file has differing samplerate, bug #1428248 (rj)
28.09
      * Always restore sequencer configuration even when song
        is loaded without config, fixes bug #1092289, midi mixer settings not restored (rj)
27.09
      * Optimizations and fixes to rubberband scrolling (rj)
      * Aux changed to be affected by volume and pan (rj)
      * Aux now affected by mute (rj)
26.09
      * Fix for pianoroll selection of events in/outside loop with respect to part offset (ml)
      * Added lasso/rubberband scrolling in arranger, drumedit and pianoroll, bug #1057732 (rj)
24.09
      * Followups by T356
      * Fixed rack plugin change not clearing automation
      * Fixed moving an empty rack position

         strip names to match icon colours
20.09
      * Fixed aux sending (rj)
      * Patch from terminator356 to fix logarithmic feedback to plugin sliders (rj)

      * Various fixes from Torsten Duwe (rj)
        - deicsonze undefined returnvalue
        - vam uninitialized value
        - 64bit fix for calling external wave editor
      * Fixed multiple part undo for move,drag and copy in arranger, bug #1516298 (rj)
      * Fixed multiple note undo for move and drag in pianoroll (rj)
      * Fixed cursor placement in List Editor upon deleting events bug #1417718 (rj)
16.09
      * Following changes by   { terminator356 [at] users [dot] sourceforge [dot] net }
      * The changes can be applied to muse-0.7.2preX or muse-0.8.1 and work fine in both.
      * Fixed soloing. Also multiple soloing now allowed.
        - TODO: Soloing of tracks which feed a group. Workaround for now: Solo the tracks AND the group.
      * Enabled solo buttons on the mixer strips.
      * Fixed major issues with rack plugin moving, saving and loading.
      * Fixed problems with multiple tempo changes and incorrect wave part lengths.
      * Changed plugin code to use double instead of float to stop certain errors, and consistency.
      * Fixed some minor spelling mistakes.
      * Fixed issues with audio track automation.
      * Fixed very 'jumpy' volume sliders and pan knobs under automation.
      * Fixed several other small problems. For example a duplicate define in song.h
      * Changed the way audio track automation works.
        - For ease of use, the current mode now remains selected, even after a file write and re-open.
        - To reduce the chance of accidental changes, for added visual warning, Touch and Write modes
           colour the automation mode box red.
        - Write and Touch modes: Only if the controls were touched, changes will be stored when
           the transport is stopped. Since the current mode remains active, you can move to
           another part and do some more automation.
        - Write mode: The controls are updated with stored values until you touch them, then they
           store from the time you hit play to the time you hit stop. If you touch the controls AFTER
           you hit play, you may get unexpected results so remember to initialize that 'first value'
           (at the time when you hit play), since muse will NOT 'fill in' from the time you hit play
           to the time you first touched the control, with the value of that first touch. (Maybe support
           this later).
        - If you load a plugin preset, if the control values don't seem correct, try setting the track's
           automation to 'Off', because the track will usually be on 'Read' - reading stored values.
        - TODO: Muse really needs an automation editor/viewer! Perhaps integrate with wave viewer.
                Also, add one more automation mode: 'Instant mode'.
      * Hmmm, oh yes - added full LADSPA plugin automation. Check it out!
        Compatibility with existing med files' Plugin section should be OK, but if you open an
         existing med file with plugins, and the plugins' control values are no longer correct,
         let me know. See comments (with these changes applied) audiotrack.cpp around line 557.
        - TODO: Checkbox automation not working right. We need a better checkbox - one which checks
                 as soon as you press down! Also would like to add bypass and mute automation.

      * Backported open/save dialog improvements (rj)
      * Added -r parameter to allow MusE to start without RTC

             GUI (currently only impl. for MESSS soft synths).
             The GUI is startet as a separate process connected
             to the midi instrument. The gui sends midi commands
             (sysex) to stdout. This midi data stream is connected
             to the midi instrument port.

            - play
      - fixed: graphic master editor: missing display refresh
        after signature change

        "midi thru" now is associated with a track, if set all input
        to that track is echoet to track port/channel

0.4.5:
      MESSS: (MusE Experimental Software Synthesizer interface Spec):
        A software synthesizer is implemented as a dynamic
        loadable library (*.so file) with two interfaces to the
        outside world:

            - a LADSPA interface for audio output
            - a midi sequencer interface registered to ALSA

      MusE searches all available synths and presents a list
      in Config->SoftSynthesizer. To use a synthesizer you have
      to create an instance. Several instances of an synt can be
      created and used. Every instance creates

        a) an alsa midi sequencer port (look at Config->MidiPorts)
        b) a new strip in the audio mixer

      As a demo i ported a stripped down version of the iiwu
      software synthesizer (http://www.iiwu.org) to MusE.
      Setup info is in README.softsynth
