        internal record flag state in many situations. (kybos)
    - Fix: Inconsistent state of (pseudo-)record-arm icon and mixer strip button in Audio 
        output tracks after loading of some files. (kybos)
    - Fix #717: Record button mustn't be activated when no track is record-armed
        (a warning message is displayed now). 
        Record button is automatically deactivated when no track is armed. (kybos)
    - Fix: Don't allow deselecting all tracks, as this hides the mixer
        strip which then can't receive events and gets out-of-sync. (kybos) 
    - Fix: Add own icon for Audio output Downmix trigger to avoid confusion
        with the arm-record indicators. (kybos)
    - Add: New vector icons. (kybos)
04.04.2021
    - Part resizing and other fixes. (Tim)
      Rewrite of part resizing routines, esp to the left.
      No longer possible to have hidden events before left border,
       would require integer negative event times. Too much work ATM.
      When resizing, use Ctrl key to choose whether to 'drag' all
       events along with the border.
    - Midi controller cache: Fixed problems when parts or tracks muted,
       or tracks off. Cache was not updated properly.
    - Undo/Redo: Fixed a problem where the Redo list was cleared 
       and the Redo button was disabled even when only non-undoable
       operations were executed, such as simply when stopping the
       transport (which executes non-undoable EnableAllAudioControllers).
    - Arranger and Wave Editor: Embellished wave drawing with dotted
       event boundary lines and coloured wave boundary lines.
      (Due to a Qt drawing bug, I had to break up long patterned lines!)

    - New: Part color toolbar. Drowdown to select current part color,
            button to assign current color (or track color) to selected parts. (kybos)
    - Fix: Parts created by double-click in range ignoring current part color. (kybos)
16.02.2021
    - LinuxVST synths: Replaced songfile midistate with customData state block. (Tim)
      Uses compressed base64 just like several of our other areas.

    - New: Menu option to Save As Template (rj) 
12.02.2021
    - Fix: Reworked Save As..., Project dialog and Save Revision. (rj)
      Project dialog is now only used on the initial save, after that
      the Save As dialog is used. For very quick Save As operation, 
      use the Save Revision alternative which will increase a number
      at the end of the name to save a new version as quickly as possible.

      the case where you want to save but does not need the full
      create project dialog (rj)
    - Fixed keyboard track selection after duplicating tracks,
      it didn't like that multiple tracks was selected, if track
      up/down is done while multiple are selected it now picks the
      first instead of nothing at all. The source track is also
      deselected (rj)
    - Fixed automation point value printing for logarithmic values (rj)
    - Changed automation add events to place them on the automation 
      line instead of where the mouse is placed, which often is 
      slightly offset (rj)
    - Added the ability to cache midi event length when adding events
      with the mouse, this is to speed up adding similar events as
      it now will default to this length. Idea from a discussion
      on linuxmusicians forum (rj)
19.01.2021

    - For issue 920: More values (480-based) in global settings midi division list. (Tim)
20.12.2020
    - Fix: Most plugin native UI windows now should behave sensibly out of the box 
            on HiDPI (of course plugins with no HiDPI/scaling support still look tiny,
            but there should be no oversized or broken Qt windows around them).
            Global setting for the HiDPI fix is now on by default, but is only active when
            at least one Hi-Res screen is found. The container window should now also 
            adjust to specific screen in multi monitor setups. (kybos)
    - Fix: More fixes for Surge and others on HiDPI. Native UI window now resizes 
            correctly when the zoom level in Surge itself is changed. (kybos)
19.12.2020
    - Fix: More fixes for HiDPI withLV2 native UIs. Surge synth should now 
            display an adequately scaled UI and not misbehave on resizing any more.

        Ctrl+Shift+Alt works, opening all track parts in a new window. (kybos)
    - New: Added status bar. Can be optionally hidden in GUI settings.
        Moved CPU load display to status bar, xruns > 1 displayed in red (reset
        by doubleclick). CPU toolbar remains available but is hidden by default.

        It's still possible to open duplicate windows by holding Shift when
        double-clicking the part or clicking the corresponding menu entry.
        Added a new submenu to open editors in new windows.
        Added new keyboard shortcuts for that. (kybos)

08.09.2020
    - Settings > Midi Division fixes: Full re-work of grid raster and snap system (Tim):
    - Replaced INCORRECT hard-coded snap/raster fixed-value tables throughout,
       with new class MusEGui::Rasterizer, provides CORRECT dynamic raster tables
       that change values, and dimensions, when global Midi Divison changes.
      There is one single global instance of this new class.
    - New class MusEGui::RasterizerModel works with class Rasterizer to provide a
       Qt model for use with combo boxes for example. Specific columns and maximum
       number of rows can be specified. Model is specially designed for rasters
       (for ex. in pianoroll the first row is three columns wide and says 'off').
    - New class RasterLabelCombo replaces hard-coded raster snap combo boxes.
      Works with class RasterizerModel. With a high Midi Division more rows appear,
       meaning HIGH-RESOLUTION editing is possible, rivaling that of frames.
      New classes RasterizerListView, RasterizerTableView, and RasterizerTreeView
       provide three types of views for RasterLabelCombo.
    - Wave Editor: Added a 'Snap' combo box (RasterLabelCombo).
    - Grid lines: Fixed problems with unwanted red grid line colours.
    - Removed never-used GUI Division from Settings.
    - Canvases: Area before bar # 1 now FIXED WIDTH regardless of Midi Division
       or magnification, by rearranging xorg/yorg origin stuff in class View,
       ie. origin is no longer magnified.
04.09.2020
    - New streamlined GUI: 
      Tabbed MDI as default, with the option to detach/float the graphical editor 
      windows, per preset or dynamically (mainly for use with multi-monitor setups). 
      List based editors (markers, clips, master list, midi events) changed to docks.
      Arranger as the central point is fixed to the main window, 
      not longer detachable/closeable. (kybos) 
    - Reused snap/quantize shortcuts in midieditors (1-6) as snap shortcuts in arranger
      as I discovered it was missing, and it's pretty much the same thing. Also
      added a shortcut for setting quantize to off (8). Execution slightly
      annoying as changing the quantize in the midi editors after having it
      at off will always give triplets (which can be turned of by pressing T).
      Fixing that would require a more extensive rewrite. (rj)
03.09.2020
    - Fixed crash in #842 extending parts to the left often caused a crash (rj)

    - Piano: Made selection/current/pressed marker colors customizable. (kybos)
    - Piano: Made piano width changeable from stylesheet. (kybos)

30.07.2020
    - Moved rewind on stop shortcut from arranger to global, fixes issue #839 (rj)
29.07.2020
    - Midi export: Format 1: First track must have only timing/marker events etc, no notes. (Tim)
    - Midi import: Don't create a first track if no events left once stripped of recognized/absorbed
       events. In format 1, first file track is supposed to be reserved for timing/markers.
    - Midi import/export: New! Key signatures supported - supports 'minor' keys as well.
    - Score editor: New! Key signature names shown at top of staff. Minor keys supported.
25.07.2020
    - Midi import: Fixed importation of SMPTE/MTC division midi files. (Tim)
      Converts linear time to ticks. Ignores existing MusE tempo map so that
       it plays at original speed - this allows the tempo map to be set up beforehand
       without actually affecting the song.
16.07.2020
    *** MusE 3.1.1 *** 
27.06.2020
    - Midi patch popup menu: Include patch number in the items' text. (Tim)
    - Mixer strip labels: Added popup 'expand' button, to expand/close the strips.
26.06.2020
    - Fixed bug left over from 21.01.2019: Midi controller graphs: Drag n drop broken. (Tim)
      Items were wrongly being erased after dropping.
    - Fixed issue 830: Wave Editor: Copy-on-write always triggered. Error from 01.01.2020
    - Fixed issue 831: Compressed song files (.gz,.bz2): Blank song on load. Error from 01.01.2020
25.06.2020
    - Some rework of mixer strip shortcuts. They now work in both Arranger and Mixer.
      Default shortcuts are Alt + Arrow keys to affect selected strip(s) (rj)
22.06.2020
    - Fix slider/meter groove misalignment in mixer strip. (kybos)
20.06.2020
    - Cmake option changes (Tim): Removed ancient ENABLE_VST and ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL,
       and dangerous ENABLE_LV2_MAKE_PATH, and enabled ENABLE_PYTHON by default since
       it has been thoroughly updated. No code removed. PLEASE REBUILD your MusE !
19.06.2020
    - Fixed long-time meter and slider scale mis-alignment. New stylesheet property meterSpacing. (Tim)
    - Midi controller graphs: Fixed no repaint when adjusting vertical splitters.
      Clear WA_StaticContents in CtrlCanvas ctor - need full update because contents scale.
    - Midi controller graphs: Moved 'Add ctrl' button from bottom area to menu and toolbar as well.
18.06.2020
    - Mixer + strips: Replace hard-coded shortcuts with configurable ones. Several weren't working. (Tim)
      New mixer shortcut category.
    - Updated Simpledrums so all parameters update a status field, previously
      it was impossible to know what the dials were set to. Changing the look
      of the dials would also be a good idea, left to do. (rj)
17.06.2020
    - Fix main window being too small on large screens when MusE is started for the first time. 
      The size and position are now adjusted dynamically for the current screen size. (kybos)
    - Fix main window size/position set to random values when a project or template is opened.
      The window is now only resized if the file contains explicit geometry information. (kybos)
    - Fix progress bar not being displayed when opening files. (kybos)
    - Mixers: Maximize button removed. Certain window managers ignore a set maximum size. (Tim)
16.06.2020
    - Replace invisible icons in file dialogs in new dark theme. (kybos)
    - Unify colour configuration file naming. (kybos)
    - Fix invalid Global area default in file save dialog. (kybos)
    - Fixed some bugs with Cursor mode in drum editor (rj)
    - Effects rack: Ensure updateGeometry is called if number of rack items changed. (Tim)
      Was not required for at least suse, but required for at least mint cinnamon.
13.06.2020
    - Add option to hide menu icons. (kybos)
12.06.2020
    - Menu: 'Mixer Automation' is deprecated, MusEGlobal::automation now fixed TRUE
       for now until we decide what to do with it. (Tim)
11.06.2020
    - Audio: Fixed bad feedback / pinned meters with muted tracks in play mode. (Tim)
      Was problem near end of WaveTrack::getData(), what constitutes "have data" or not.
      Said "have data" when there was none when muted, causing AudioTrack::copyData()
       to build up feedback data in the buffers instead of clearing them.
10.06.2020
	- Arranger: Removed the small toggle button for mixer strip display/hide and cleaned up the layouts.
	  Function is now accessible from menu (Display->Toggle Mixer Strip) or by pressing F3.
09.06.2020
    - Fix regression from 07.06: Qt::endl and Qt::dec only from Qt >= 5.14 (Tim)
07.06.2020
    - Fix Qt 5.14 / 5.15 deprecations (Tim)
      QString::SplitBehavior > Qt::SplitBehavior, QTextStream::endl > Qt::endl, QTextStream::dec > Qt::dec,
      Qt::WindowFlags f = 0 > Qt::WindowFlags f = Qt::Widget, QWheelEvent::delta > QWheelEvent::pixel/angleDelta,
      QWheelEvent::globalPos > QWheelEvent::globalPosition::toPoint, QWheelEvent::pos > QWheelEvent::position.toPoint.
06.06.2020
    - Fixed regression at 23.05.2020: Crash in viewMouseReleaseEvent. Copy/paste typo. (Tim)
    - Many new customizing features implemented, internal colors, css properties.
	  New theme created (Dark Flat) as a showcase/proof of concept. (kybos)
04.06.2020
    - Fixed blank mixers upon auto-restart. (Tim)
    - Make MusE QMainWindow own the mixers. They had no owner, no deletion. Leak? Test OK so far.
    - Reload the last song upon auto-restart. Templates included, and midi config loading choice.
      Was tricky, possible wee corrections later...?
27.05.2020
    - Midi controller panel: Replaced 'Ctrl', 'S', and 'X' button text with svg icons. (Tim)
    - Midi controller panel: Replaced 'per-note-velocity' bitmap with button and svg icon.
    - Midi Controller panel redesign: Create only required controls, not keep all 4 alive but hidden.
24.05.2020
    - Fix regression at 06.04.2020: Can't connect Jack ports to audio input/output tracks R chan. (Tim)
      Don't check out of bounds index in AudioInput/Output::registerPorts(). When it is called by
       Audio::msgSetChannels(), the new number of channels has not been set yet.
    - Added support for adjusting automation for Global structure cut/insert (rj)
    - LV2: Fix plugins without 'programs extension' support: Send directly as midi events. (Tim)
      Fixes plugins like gmsynth.lv2, which have midnam support but no programs extension support.
23.05.2020
    * New - PianoRoll Speaker button has two selectable modes, single note and chords: (Tim)
16.05.2020
    - Popup menus: Changed the text '<More...>' in submenus, to the first item's text in the submenu. (Tim)
    - Oops, removed redundant addAction() in RoutePopupMenu::addMenuItem(), causing duplicate items
       at 'More...' menu breaks.
    - Fixed regression at 03.02.2020: Plugin dialog user 'categories' not showing LV2 plugins.
18.04.2020
    - New option in Global settings -> GUI tweaks to (not) keep transport window on top (kybos)
13.04.2020
    - Fix regression from 12.04.2019: Midi controller cache not proper after loading song. (Tim)
      Since we now resolve track and instrument references AFTER a song file is FULLY loaded,
       calling addPortCtrlEvents() on all tracks BEFORE doing the resolving had ill effect.
      Now port midi control cache events are added on all tracks AFTER the resolving.
    - Simplified several sections regarding adding/removing port midi control cache events.
    - Removed ALL 'old-style drum track' code. Track type NEW_DRUM has been renamed DRUM.
    - Simplified many drum controller (per-note) code sections to call a common function
       in MidiTrack::mappedPortChanCtrl()
    - Support midnam controllers (gmsynth.lv2 for example).
      This was very difficult. Midnam supports per-channel AND per-patch controller lists.
      Instead of adapting our own instrument and controller classes to NATIVELY support that,
       which would be NICE but much more difficult and time-consuming, the instrument simply
       'compounds' its own controller list and the midnam controller list together and
       presents that to the outside code looking for a controller list.
      But no changes to our own instrument definitions and structures were made.
      This still required many changes to the outside code in order to pass the patch number.
      TODO: Midnam supports enumerated controller values. Use them!
    - Moved classes MidiController and MidiControllerList from midictrl module into a separate
       midi_controller module (library in libs) so that our midnam library can use it.
06.04.2020
    - Fixed bug 790 Crash when dragging parts to blank area. (Tim)
      Bonus: Now supports dragging parts from multiple non-contiguous tracks,
       it attempts to create new tracks for all of them.
      Bonus: The 'duplicate tracks' dialog pops up, asks what should be copied.
      Bonus: Previously, user must press undo twice to undo the move. Now a single undo.
    - Fixed 'drum ordering' bugs (drum notes order) after drag parts or duplicate tracks.
    - Fixed some flaws with track copy constructors and assign() methods.
    - Added new class TrackNameFactory. A complete list of new UNIQUE track names can
       be requested BEFORE the new tracks are added to the song. All requests for unique
       track names now go through this central class. It uses a modified version of
       Robert's smart '#' character detection and naming sequencing. Robert wrote:
       "there is still a gaping hole in the logic, making multiple duplicates of multiple
       tracks still does not produce valid results" but his logic was OK - it was the
       fact that the tracks are not added yet, which this new factory class SOLVES.
    - Streamlined and fixed some problems with audio input/output track Jack port creation.
      The ports are now only (un/)registered when the track is added/deleted.
    - Added crash protection throughout audio processing against null destination buffers,
       which may occurr if Jack ports could not be created.
    - Extracted audio input/output track port registration in setName() into a separate
       registerPorts() method. The ports are no longer registered in setName().
21.03.2020
    - Add shortcut (Ctrl+U) for opening synth UI for selected synth-track in arranger (rj)
    - Added wave part extend beyond end of part if there is more wave file (rj)
18.03.2020
	- Enable multiple resizing in piano roll (#748) (kybos)
	- Enable CTRL+Left Mouse Click item selection in edit mode in piano roll (kybos)
	- Enable Right Mouse Click for exclusive single selection in edit mode/piano roll (kybos)
17.03.2020
	- Add more information to note tooltips in midi editors (kybos)
	- Add global setting for switching off the note tooltips (kybos)
	- Remove fixed track heigth from file templates, to enforce global setting (kybos)
09.03.2020
	- Transfer Help content to github wiki, link Manual to wiki in MusE (kybos)
08.03.2020
	- Fix EditPaste cursor HiDPI issue in midi editors->controller views (kybos)
05.03.2020

	- Fix background color setting ignored in midi editors->controller views (kybos)
04.03.2020
	- Add tool context menu to Score Editor (kybos)
28.02.2020:
    - LV2: Now shows MidiName patch names (gmsynth.lv2 for example). (Tim)
    - Added share/rdf/README to describe what's there and why.
23.02.2020:
    *** Final MusE 3.1.0 *** 
21.02.2020:
    - Drum Editor: Fixed horizontal scrollbar width and 'Ctrl' button position. (Tim)
20.02.2020:
    - Partial revert of 16.02.2020. dssi-vst works now. Extra path tab was required. (Tim)
      Description labels added to dialog vst path tabs (*.dll vs. *.so etc)
      Linux vst paths now include 'lxvst'. It's a commonly used folder besides 'vst'.
      Changed all std::getenv() in plugin_cache_reader.cpp to qEnvironmentVariable().
19.02.2020:
    - Fix new drum move cursor. New Canvas::setMouseOverItemCursor() fixes hover cursor. (Tim)
18.02.2020:
    * New - MidiName instrument support, currently for LV2 : (Tim)
      Synths like DrumGizmo and AvlDrums should now show note names automatically.
      Will test FULL parser later with real midnam files, but should be OK for LV2.
16.02.2020:
    - Removed the VST tab referencing Wine VST and relabeled Native VST as VST (rj)
    - Remove Wine VST plugin type in dropdown as we only support that through
      dssi-vst and it is dead since many years
15.02.2020:
    - Fixed issue with plugin scan #763, where a valid vst plugin but nonfunctional was never
      added to the cache and hence caused a rescan every time (rj)
    - Added a question dialog for waiting for very slow plugins (like Addictive Drums 2)
14.02.2020:
    - Custom Drum Editor 'move note' cursor, fix a few others. Fix mouse-up restoration. (Tim)
13.02.2020:
    - Reverted previous addTrack change, it affected Insert menu which then behaved wrong. (rj) 
      * Changed Add Track alternative in edit menu to have this effect instead
      * Added Insert Track to edit menu also, together with shortcuts
    - Oops! Fix bug 765: Crackling in recorded files. Caused by 01.01.2020 commit. (Tim)
      Changed SndFile::write(): wrFrames = realWrite(srcChannels, src, n, liveWaveUpdate);
       to wrFrames = realWrite(srcChannels, src, n, wrFrames, liveWaveUpdate);
    - Track List: Make current selected track darker than other (multi-)selected tracks.
12.02.2020
    - Changed addTrack shortcut to insert after selected track, inserting before
      felt strange and made it impossible to insert tracks at the end (rj)
    - Drum list note names: Fixed mixing of default names with synth note names. (Tim)
      When there was no note name available from a synth for a note, it was allowing
       the default note name to appear instead. This is fixed and the note name
       will be blank now, that is, drum list should now fully respect the complete
       note name map provided by the synth - including unlisted blank names.
11.02.2020
    - Some more work on MidiName support: Completed FULL parser and C++ bindings. (Tim)
04.02.2020
    - Master track graphic editor: Fixed tempo ramp function was not undoable. (Tim)
    - Referring to 30.11.2019: "Fixed crash in drumlist when synth plugin was missing."
      Observed crash still there immediately (the drum list was empty).
      Fixed and tested OK, saving and reloading, even if synth plugin is missing. The
       drum list is filled now. Even if the missing plugin was MESS fluidsynth (unlikely),
       the default map will be used since no note names are available from the synth.
03.02.2020
    - Fix issue 763: Plugin cache recreated on each startup. (Tim)
      When there was more than one LV2 plugin with the same name (but different uri)
       such as deteriorate.lv2/downsampler* and avw.lv2/downsampler*, the cache was
       recreated every time, and only ONE of the plugins was allowed, the other ignored.
      This MAJOR REWRITE of our cache and plugin system fixes that AND allows both
       plugins, as long as the uris are different (this is allowed in LV2).
      For example, both deteriorate.lv2/downsampler* and avw.lv2/downsampler* are now shown.
      The LV2 cache file has been ELIMINATED. It was useless, not necessary, caused problems.
      To distinguish between like-named plugins, several places where plugin names are shown
       now also show the uri either as a tooltip, or appended to the name, or replacing the
       library string, such as plugin dialog, synth menu, synth config, strip labels, tracklist...
      In addition, there was a problem with dssi-vst which caused cache recreation every time,
       since the dssi-vst library installs itself in BOTH the ldaspa and dssi folders. This has
       been fixed. The ladspa cache file now contains additional ladspa and dssi dssi-vst entries.
      TODO: There is a remaining problem: A shell plugin that reports no plugins may still
       trigger cache recreation every time because there is no entry in the cache file. Such as
       dssi-vst not finding any plugins. To fix this, the cache files must change from a 'flat'
       listing to one ALWAYS listing the shell plugins - and the plugins they contain (if any).
01.02.2020
    - Global cut/insert: Overhaul. Fix crashes with markers. (Tim)
      Cherry pick from pos_ctrls_fixes branch: Redesigned markers and marker viewer.
      Marker functions now undoable! (Lack of that was causing crashes.)
    - Tempo, signature, and key maps: Fixed problems with Global cut/insert.
      Replaced complex realtime stage-2 map item-by-item operations with simple swapping
       of entire map with complete replacement map pre-composed in stage 1 (gui thread).
      Virtually zero cpu time, and realtime safe, no potential allocation or deallocation.
      TODO: Sig still seems to not undo quite correctly, possibly due to raster-snapping.
            Tempo list operations must be executed before wave part splitting! So two
             separate operations are done - user must hit undo TWICE to undo them! (Better
             that for now, rather than one single BUT INCORRECT undoable operation.)
            Most of this stuff is pre-existing. Still, it is better now ;-)
30.01.2020
    - Replace deprecated QByteArray::[] 'past-end' usage with append() in xml module. (Tim)
      Caused thousand of errors in debug mode, very slow to start up.
29.01.2020
    - Fixed and improved custom columns functionality (kybos)
26.01.2020
    - Fixed broken version comparison macro in fluidsynti.cpp (Tim)
    - Replaced obsolete QTime with QElapsedTimer. Tested OK.
    - **Bumped up** song file version to 3.3, req for some new header fixes by kybos.
24.01.2020
	- Global settings: Split GUI behaviour tab into two separate tabs (kybos)
	- Add another set of mouse shortcuts for range markers - Ctrl+Left/Ctrl+Right (kybos)
23.01.2020
	- MESS FluidSynth: Add key modifiers to distribute soundfonts to all/empty channels 
	  with single click (kybos).
15.01.2020
    - Cherry pick five things from pos_ctrls_fixes branch: (Tim)
      1) Fix when tempo serial number is incremented. (Fixes broken looping etc.)
      2) Add rounding choice to tempo tick-to-frame methods (part of pending Pos fixes).
      3) Remove awkward lone undoOp in song.h
      4) Pos class makeover: New 'lock'. Rounding choice. New method msmu() (MinSecMsecUsec).
      5) Add default getDSP_Load() in class AudioDevice, remove useless ones in RTAudio/dummy.
14.01.2020
    - LV2: Remove deprecated LV2_Event_Buffer and LV2_URI_Map_Feature. (Tim)
12.01.2020
    - Oops. Reinstall missing darkgreendot.xpm (Tim)
    - Fix compile error when RtAudio headers not found.
    - Fix "lv2host_module does not exist" compile error when LV2 support disabled.
09.01.2020
    - Fix rubberband compile error + pull trackheader size fixes from kybos. (Tim)
01.01.2020
    * NEW - Audio live! time-stretch and samplerate-stretch conversion : (Tim)
      Merge from audio-convert branch. Many changes and fixes along the way.
    - Wave editor has two new tool buttons which place two new types of markers
       on the canvas. Move the markers around to affect the sound. Click on a
       marker to select it. Press Del to delete the marker.
    - Wave module moved into separate library with no external dependencies.
    - New MuseFrame_t MuseCount_t types.
16.12.2019
    - Exposed new colours for stylesheets. See Ardour and Dark qss files. (Tim)
    - Fixed #740: sf3 files crash. libinstpatch code: We did not check returned pointers.
14.12.2019
    * NEW - Audio effects rack size increased from 4 to 8 : (Tim)
    - New right-click context menu entry on strip labels: "effects rack visible items".
13.12.2019
  - HOT Bug fix: Missing 3 MESS synths, undefined symbol MusEGlobal::config (Tim)
    Cause: #include "gconfig.h" in icons.cpp brought in core globals which should
     not be in these synth plugin libraries (or in icons module). Removed the line
     and instead passed the desired global value to initIcons().
    That said, the plugins really should be stand alone and not use the icons module
     until the icons module becomes a true shared resource library. (Currently it
     is initialized by core, so not quite self sufficient yet.) So... I copied the
     required icons to the relevant synths, decoupling them from the icons module.
    By using icons directly from qrc instead of icons module, I was also able to
     remove the icons module from inclusion in widgets module (yay!), removing
     a further dependency of simpledrums synth which was missing too.
  * Module independence is a goal to strive for after 28.01.2018 MAJOR changes.
11.12.2019
    *** MusE 3.1.0pre4 ***    
	- Customizable size of icons and custom tool cursors (kybos)
	- Replaced one-letter column headers by icons in track header (kybos)
	- German translation updated (kybos)
10.12.2019
    - Dependency problems: Moved several files. All source together with ui files now. (Tim)
    - Remove all dead obsolete trackinfo 'alt' button code.
    - FIXED: Mixer strips missing if loading an older song saved before 20.10.2019
    - FIXED: Duplicate strips found in songs saved before 20.10.2019
    - FIXED: Long-time mixer problem with restoring size.
09.12.2019
    - Remove some more "old vs. new" drum track stuff, change some text etc. (Tim)
08.12.2019
	- Added option for opening MDI subwindows maximized (kybos)
    - Oops, fix stuck icons from 06.12. (Tim)
    - Fix gross misnomer throughout, should be "timebase master, not "transport master".
    - Fix EffectRack::songChanged() crash when reloading songs: Check track still exists. (Tim)
07.12.2019
    - Update start play position when making a seek. Rewind to Start behaves
      more logical then, imho (rj)
    - Fix some compile warnings with LV2 worker functions, some others. (Tim)
    - Moved appearance and confmport cpp/h files from /muse to muse/components.
      Trying to solve some dependency problems...
06.12.2019
    - Fixed bug #719 downmix to existing file appends to the old file (rj)
    - Transport master fixes: New button on transport. Fix connect at startup etc. (Tim)
      Seems there is no way to ask Jack if are we transport master (without setting it).
      So new code in our Jack driver - and a 1Hz watchdog - monitor for changes to master status.
      Care was taken to not disturb who else may be master. Click flashing button to force.
      Tested the new button OK with three instances of MusE competing for transport master.
05.12.2019
	- Added File->New from template... menu entry. File->New loads default template (kybos)
	- Fixed inconsistent UI texts where appropriate: (kybos)
	  * Title-style for menu texts and window titles
	  * Sentence-style for all other UI texts 
	  * Three dots (...) for menu entries triggering a dialog (like Save As...)
	- Fixed inconsistent tooltip font size (kybos)
	- Vector replacements for many pixmap icons (kybos)
	- Fixed bug #720 arm follows track did bad things while recording (rj)
03.12.2019
    - Eliminated all but one tr("Empty") string usage in plugins/pipeline/rack. (Tim)
    - Snooper: Provide flashColor property. Changed it in Ardour and Dark qss themes.
30.11.2019
    - Added a specialization of QMdiArea to work around problems with PgUp and PgDown
      shortcuts as it was found through Snooper tool that this is the widget that
      was stealing the keypresses.
    - Another keypress fix in pcanvas.cpp to allow Return to be captured
    - Fixed a crash in drumlist when using a drummap and opening without the port having 
      been properly initialized (in this case the synth plugin was missing). The 
      dm->port had an extreme value, now the range is checked. (rj)
    - Fix #697: On HiDPI displays, plugin native UI windows are automatically
      scaled by Qt, but most of the native plugin UIs are not scalable 
      or apply their own scaling. There is now a global setting for reverting 
      the Qt window scaling. It can be overridden for each soft synth track
      by a local setting in the Quirks toolbar. (kybos)
    - Fix # 708: Surge-vst crashes. It called our pluginHostCallback() immediately from
       instantiate() before we stored the pointer. Added VstNativeSynth::openPlugin() (Tim)
28.11.2019
    - Fixed the DidYouKnow menu alternative so it shows the dialog even if the
      checkbox for not displaying it is checked. (rj)
    - Added a few more lines to the DidYouKnow.txt database
    - Snooper improvements, fix crashes, fix 'parented top level' not working right. (Tim)
27.11.2019
    - Unfortunately had to revoke the 'easy fix' below for getting more shortcuts to work
      there were side effects...  The search goes on for the 'real' solution (rj)
    - Snooper improvements. Moved to Help menu. Live realtime monitoring of events. (Tim)
26.11.2019
    * New - Introducing the Snooper (object tree) for coders and stylesheet authors: (Tim)
      Click new Snooper button in Appearance to start. Then click on anything anywhere.
23.11.2019
    - More keyboard shortcuts
      * First of, I found out that several shortcuts never end up in the dispatcher since they (rj)
        were tested against the "accepted" property. Seems this is not reliable nor needed,
        it affected atleast PgUp, PgDn and Return.
      * Arm currently selected track can now be bound: Default Ctrl+Return
      * Goto end of song can be bound: Shift+W
22.11.2019
    - New solution to making bar lines more visible. Basically removed more hardcoded colors
      and made them configurable in the appearance dialog (rj)
    - Fixed escape-key shortcut for closing a few more dialogs/editors:
      master track list/graphical, instrument editor (rj)
    - Advanced router stylesheet support: New property 'RouteTreeWidget::categoryColor'. (Tim)
      Also specific instance IDs Router_input_tree and Router_output_tree, if desired.
21.11.2019
    - Add command line option -C "Do not re-create plugin cache." (Tim)
      Avoids (looong) repeated re-creations in some cases. Helps devs avoid after rebuilds. 
19.11.2019
    - Soundfont *.sf3 files: Small tweak allows our MESS fluidsynth to load them. (Tim)
18.11.2019
    - Add dedicated new 'mute parts' svg icon, for 17.11 (Tim)
    - Bug 681: Fix multichannel track feeding aux track, no audio. In AudioTrack::copyData().
    - Fixed metronome selection of wave files, the selection in the ui 
      didn't actually do anything. (rj)
17.11.2019
	  - Introduce new scalable icons and cursors for edit tools (kybos)
	    Improved cursor interaction in piano roll/drum editor (event canvas vs. control canvas),
	    cursor shape shows when cursor has no function in given area
	    Consistent cursor shape display in all editors affected (midi, part, score, master, wave)
	    Correct cursor size on HiDPI screens (fixes issue #637)
    - LV2: Fix sequencing/syncing plugins (Helm, LV2 metronome, NoiseMak3r...) (Tim)
      Fixed TimePosition usage. Add quirks class for different plugin behaviour observed.
    - Generic plugin UI: Added 'Quirks' buttons to toolbar:
       "fixed speed" (fixes NoiseMak3r modulator stuck in small loop in stop mode for ex.),
       "transport affects latency" (self-correcting LV2 Example Metronome for ex.), and
       "override reported latency" (for plugins with broken or inaccurate latency reporting).
12.11.2019
      *** MusE 3.1.0pre3 ***
11.11.2019
      - Added tab in Aboutbox with some runtime of MusE, feel free to add more (rj)
      - Disabled rate and size for audio device when Jack is selected as we currently
        cannot change this from within MusE (rj)
09.11.2019
      - Reorganize instrument popup menu. (Tim)
08.11.2019
      - Fixed missing font scaling in drum editor at lower zoom level (kybos)
      - LV2: Fixed program_changed callback lv2prg_Changed(), seemed completely wrong. (Tim)
07.11.2019
      - Add: Tooltip for current note/instrument in the midi editors (kybos)
06.11.2019
      - Adjusted raster drawing in view.cpp so it would draw lines that didn't (rj)
        draw correctly on my rig. We'll see if anyone objects
      * New - Instrument can now be changed on a Synth Track: (Tim)
        For example you can now set 'GM2' or 'My cool instrument' on ANY synth track.
        Not as useless/dangerous as it sounds. Tested OK saving/loading/changing instruments.
      - Add: Range selection (shift-click) for tracks (kybos)
05.11.2019
      - Oops. Restore auto-create user instruments folder, likely swept away by 03.09 (Tim)
04.11.2019
      - Implemented issue 644: Rewind on stop (rj)
        Added setting directly on Settings-menu as I
        think this might be a setting that is often changed
        might even consider making a toolbar button.
      - Some cleanups, especially the addition of using of an enum for CPOS,LPOS,RPOS
03.11.2019
      - Fix issue 667: Hang on automatic restart. Reset jackStarted upon restart. (Tim)
      - Fix issue 638: Font too small in popups started from mixer strip (kybos)
      - Add: Double click on track ID selects all tracks of the same type (kybos)
      - Fix: Change piano keys in piano roll to rectangular shapes to avoid pixelation when scaled (kybos)
02.11.2019
      - Mixers and strips: Mods and reverts to 20.10. (Tim)
        Removed new track UUID. Found a way to work with track index and a local LUID instead.
      - New: Persistent synth tracks. One consequence of the above fix is that synth tracks
         are preserved if the synth is not found. All data is preserved if project is saved.
      - Class EvData rewrite: Safer. Members protected. New methods such as resize().
30.10.2019
      - Fix some memory leaks reported by heaptrack. Still others are puzzling... (Tim)
29.10.2019
      - Latency correction: Fix feedback/noise using channel routing (vs. omni routing). (Tim)
      - Fix issue 666: Crash if 'Prefer knobs not sliders' clicked on disabled instrument. (Tim)
        Changed delete to deleteLater() in ComponentRack::clearDelete()
        Disabled label was trying to call clearDelete() which deletes itself.
28.10.2019
      * LV2 Major rewrite of state/worker support and more, fixes several synths: (Tim)
      - Worker message data now uses new LockFreeDataRingBuffer for bidi comm.
        Fixes major problems with synth workers.
      - Fixed problems with how our worker thread is awoken. Fixes several plugins.
      - Fixed problems with how our EvBuf reads port data. Fixes several plugins.
      - Fixed state file storing/reading and locations. State files are stored
         in a unique configuration folder for each plugin, even if the song file
         is not in its own folder.
      - All file references IN or UNDER the song project folder are deemed RELATIVE,
         to the plugin's configuration folder. All file references OUTSIDE the song
         file folder are deemed ABSOLUTE.
      - New cmake option ENABLE_LV2_MAKE_PATH, it is disabled by default !!!
        If enabled (NOT RECOMMENDED), the above mentioned configuration folders are used.
        If disabled, NO external files or folders are created parallel to the song file.
        This is what we want with MusE, all data stored inside the song file if possible.
      - Tested OK saving/reloading several synths that were broken before.
20.10.2019
      * Mixer and strips - Save entire state. Fix label text: (Tim)
      - Entire state of mixer is now saved, including user-adjusted strip widths.
        The state is preserved even if no mixers are opened (created) during
         a session. This required re-working the mixer and strip configuration
         (song and config xml files) to be more persistent.
      - Mixer widths restoration: Fixed (hopefully) long-time problem with mixers
         not opening at their stored song size if the mixers are already open.
      - Strip track labels: Replaced multi-line word-wrap with elided (...) text.
        Reduced variable-font variation somewhat to avoid too-small fonts.
        Added tooltips on the labels to help see the full text.
13.10.2019
      - Improvements to 11.10. Fix accuracy problems (re)storing view state. (Tim)
      - Jack midi: Suppress repetitive warnings of unused Midi Sense (ME_SENSE 0xfe).
11.10.2019
      * Midi Editor now keeps state (zoom, pos, controllers) after closing: (Tim)
        Works on a per-part basis: Whatever you set on a part it remembers.
        Pianoroll Editor and Drum Editor done.
09.10.2019
      - Pianoroll Editor: Increased default vertical zoom level from 1 to 2. (Tim)
        Was challenging. The global variable 'yscale' in pianoroll.cpp had no effect
         no matter what I put there. Fixed class ScrollScale (the slider!), had a
         problem with the initial scale. Replaced its curious successive approximation
         log() code with an actual log10() call, rounded up! Tested OK.
05.10.2019
      - Merge PR 665 from hfiguiere: Remove unused "all.h" and all relevant code. (Tim)
      - Fix crash: SimplerPlugin (LadspaPlugin). Regression of 03.09. Wrong cache loc.
03.10.2019
      - Redesign: All SongChanged flags are now 128-bit (split two 64-bit). (Tim)
        128 bits of flags split as two 64-bit values in class SongChangedStruct_t,
         to support 32-bit OSs where 128 bit integers may not be available.
        All the SC_* #defines are now wrapped in a SongChangedStruct_t constructor.
        The new upper 64 bits are optional. They default to zero in the constructor.
      - Setting of extSyncFlag, useJackTransport, and useMasterFlag are now operations
         synchronized with audio. extSyncFlag and useJackTransport are now simple booleans.
      - Removed obsolete experimental _AUDIO_USE_TRUE_FRAME_ code.
15.09.2019
      - Event List Editor: Rebuild upon time signature changes, shows correct BBTs. (Tim)
03.09.2019
      - Replaced all hard-coded paths in main.cpp with QStandardPaths. (Tim)
        *** NOTE: This means the location of MusE config files and names have changed!
        Everything has been moved to ~/.config/MusE/MusE EXCEPT the qt config file
         which remains in ~/.config/MusE. The MusE config file 'MusE.cfg' has been
         renamed 'MusE-seq.cfg'. The MusE qt config file 'MusE-qt.conf' has been
         renamed 'MusE.conf'. The QApplication now has an organization name,
         application name, and organization domain. All QSettings usages now defer
         to these values instead of hard-coding QSettings("MusE", "MusE-qt").
        These changes comply with QStandardPaths policies and QSettings behaviour.
      - Replaced getenv with qEnvironmentVariable or qgetenv in main.cpp
      - Disabled loading of default template files 'MusE-seq.cfg' and 'MusE.conf'
         when either was not found. They should not be required. All default values
         housed in the global config struct or other classes are now honoured.
01.09.2019
      * Command line complete redesign using QCommandLineParser: (Tim)
        Supports long options. Qt text translations enabled.
        Cross-platform, no getopt used.
      * Python remote control redesign:
        Uses QThread instead of pthreads to start/stop the Pyro server.
        Launcher python code simplified. No custom event loop.
        Uses daemon loopCondition to cleanly shutdown.
        New MusE command line options for the python bridge:
        --pyro-ns-host<host>  --pyro-ns-port<port>
        --pyro-daemon-host=<host> --pyro-daemon-port<port>
        --pyro-comm-timeout<time (s)>
27.08.2019
      * New! Restored Python remote control: (Tim)
      - Completely updated to Pyro4.
      - Compiles with Python 2 or 3.
      - The API, the launcher, and ALL examples have been updated.
      - Enabled with a cmake option and -y command line option, as before.
      - BONUS: Either works with an ALREADY running Pyro NS, or else starts it.
      - See new README.python for details.
      - TODO: Some operations in pyapi.cpp:Song::event() are not realtime safe,
         and do not allow undo (maybe that's a good thing - too many operations?).
23.08.2019
      - MASSIVE tedious fixes: gcc9 and Qt obsoletes/deprecates causing compile failure. (Tim)
        Replaced implicit copy constructors or assignment operators with explicit:
         MPEvent, MidiRecordEvent, MidiPlayEvent, Pos.
        Replaced ALL obsolete QSignalMapper uses, and some more (but certainly not all yet)
         SIGNAL/SLOTs with Qt5 lambdas. (Very tedious, but at least mappers are all lambdas now!)
        Replaced ALL (tons!) obsolete QFontMetrics::width() calls with ::horizontalAdvance().
        Replace ALL obsolete qCopy() calls with std::copy().
      - Fix 'ConstantLength' Python plugin: Error: PyQt4 not installed. Converted to Qt5. Test OK.
      - Fix audio controls right-click automation 'set event': Failed unless 'touch' or 'write' on.
        Call _aud_ctrl_list->add not insert in PendingOperationItem::executeRTStage() (AddAudioCtrlVal).
      - Fix Score Editor: Delete notes crashes. Corrupt non-const Part* cast in ScoreCanvas::tagItems().
17.07.2019
      - LV2: Fix plugins using worker extension, such as *v1 suite (drumkv1 etc.) (Tim)
        When plugins pass us worker message data, don't just copy the pointer, copy the data.
        The data is usually local in the plugin and goes out of scope by the time a worker
         thread gets it, causing corruption (TM). Installed a std::vector for this purpose.
15.07.2019
      - LV2: Removed ALL internal LV2 support. Too hard to maintain. (Tim)
        And to get important changes sooner, we would need risky git versions of the libs.
      - Support nominalBlockLength feature and coarseBlockLength property.
      - Changed LV2_P_MIN_BLKLEN value from 'segmentSize' to 0, since we might vary the run.
      - For plugin sub-runs, treat PluginPowerOf2BlockSize like fixed size for now.
        TODO: Better support by quantizing the control period to power of 2.
01.07.2019
      - libinstpatch fix: Newer libinstpatch.pc replaces old libinstpatch-1.0.pc (Tim)
30.06.2019
      - Audio: Fixed old bug hopefully, yay! Symptom: Load a song, press play, and get like this:
         "FIFO 0xda8d600 underrun" "WaveTrack::getData(Playback track) (A) fifo underrun"
        Cures: In Audio::seek() do not return if we are already at the requested position -
         let it update the prefetch fifo. Modified Audio::sync() to NOT repeatedly call seek()
         if waiting for sync. Tested OK with precount, seek-while-precount, seek-while-seek etc.
29.06.2019
      * New! Comprehensive full midi and audio latency correction / compensation: (Tim)
      - This was a very tough problem to solve.
      - Currently DISABLED by default until certain it is OK.
        You must enable it. See the new Global Settings > Latency tab.
      - Features: 'Corrects' (looks ahead) or 'compensates' (delays) ALL audio and midi
         signals throughout. Recorded or played audio files should be TRUSTWORTHY now,
          regardless of audio driver period size.
      - Tested extensively with many configurations. Should be OK for usage trials.
      - Works OK with plugins that report latency (properly). It accounts for their latency.
      - Works OK with Audio Output track sends or Midi output sends and Audio Input returns.
      - Works OK with 'Bounce to file/track' function, with or without Jack Freewheel enabled.
      - TODO: Support Aux(illiary) tracks. Not handled at all ATM.
              Fix small snippet of missing sound at start of all playback material. Should be
               played BEFORE transport rolls. Use 'slow-sync' feature to hold up the transport.
              Add user-adjustment boxes on hardware ports. (Enter results from jack_iodelay for ex.)
14.05.2019
      - Include RTC support only if ALSA support enabled. See issue 584 (BSD support).  (Tim)
      - Fix for github issue 646 "Select Directory" dialogs freezes MusE. (Tim)
        For a known Qt bug: QFileDialog freezes with a Gnome environment.
        In the bug report, a user said he fixed it by NOT supplying a parent. That is what I did.
      - Fix problem with loading lv2 presets on '<More...>' popup menu pages. Reported in forums.
      - Some fixes submitted for BSD support:
        Remove all dlopen() RTLD_DEEPBIND usage. Add some missing headers.
      - Users must now specifically set cmake option ENABLE_LV2_SUPPLIED to use built-in
         LV2 libraries, we will NOT automatically fall back to them now, to avoid problems.
      - Fix confusing DSSI and OSC cmake warning messages, per issue 655.
01.05.2019
      - Fix quantize dialogs in pianoroll, arrangerview, scoreedit. Regression at 21.01.2019 (Tim)
12.04.2019
      - Fixed midi import problem as reported in forums: (Tim)
        Importing tracks with duplicate (often blank) names caused problems with
         'drum_ordering' and 'route' song file sections since they refer to track names.
        Re-wrote to use track indexes instead of track names.
        Optimized and compacted the 'drum_ordering' section.
      - Added new Arranger column 'Track Index'. Helps identify blank or duplicate track names.
      - **Bumped up** song file version to 3.2, necessary for the new track header column.
      - Added Track::displayName() and Route::displayName(). They return strings such as
         "1:Track 5" and "2:" "3:" to help identify tracks.
        All places displaying a track name, such as routing popup and dialog, now show
         this 'augmented' display name to help identify blank or duplicate track names.
      - Fixed many semantic, code-will-never-run, allocation, header-not-guarded,
         and other problems as displayed by KDevelop Problems Reporter.
      - Fixed Midi Input Transformator and Midi Transformator problems.
        Problems creating/deleting presets. Tested all functions OK.
25.03.2019
      - Fix issue 645 "Naming a track with acentuated letter". (Tim)
        Oops, regression from 07.01.2019: utf8 chars were corrupted.
        Reverted by re-adding QByteArray stuff, required for proper parsing.
      - Also fixed many double &amp; in *.idf files and a few other things.
      - Fixed bug in storing sysex comment xml section of midi instruments.
        It was doing escape replacements twice, corrupting the text.
24.03.2019
      - Fix Time Signature boxes on toolbars: Could not adjust if 'use mastertrack tempo' was off. (Tim)
        Oops, regression from 22.04.2018
23.03.2019
      * Metronome super-makeover: (Tim)
      * New metronome accents editor with factory and user presets:
      - Choice of global vs. song metronome settings.
      - Re-design metronome dialog, separating into tabs.
      - NOTE: Qt signal/slots macros are OBSOLETE!
        Implemented first usage of Qt 'connect' functors and C++11 lambdas, in metronome dialog.
        Strange, some Qt classes don't seem to have functors? (QCheckBox, QComboBox.)
11.03.2019
      - Fixed build issues for vanilla Debian 9 (rj)
10.03.2019
      - Fixed regression with storing decimal values in song file, they
        were using locale's decimal type, now stores with decimal point (rj)
03.03.2019
      - Fix LinuxVST duplicates in plugin list if duplicate plugins exist. (Tim)
02.03.2019
      - Plugin scanner: Redesign fixes problems with 'auto-rescan' trigger. (Tim)
        Significant changes: Previously folders were scanned for date/time differences
         compared to the cache file's date/time. This caused unwanted rescans if ANY
         file or folder inside changed. Now it is all *.so file centric. Now, ALL *.so
         files found are registered in our caches, and a new 'file timestamp' member
         was added, and a new "unknown_plugins.scan" cache file added. Then on next start
         it compares date/time of what exists in our cache with what is actually on the system.
      - Fixed remaining compile issues with various options disabled.
        Tested by turning off ALL cmake options. Revealed an error: We never linked
         pthreads into the core! With cross-platform in mind, this was followed:
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49768454/whats-the-differences-between
         -pthread-and-pthread-options-in-cmake (the 'modern' answer at bottom).
01.03.2019
      - Added README.editor-shortcuts with keyboard shortcuts for midi and drum editor (rj)
      - Extended plugin scan wait time to 9 seconds, needed by Addictive Drums 2 atleast (rj)
25.02.2019
      *** MusE 3.1.0pre1 ***
      - Added cosmetic highlight lines in arranger for every numbered line (rj)
      - Added shortcut for renaming a part (rj)
      - Added a text filter to the shortcut dialog (rj)
      - finally start preparing for 3.1 (rj)
19.02.2019
      - Issue 639: Make 'midi remote' dialog box more clear. (Tim)
      - Fix M_PI from last commit. Don't detect in cmake, hard-code #ifdef M_PI for now.
17.02.2019
      - Fix all uses of exp10(). (Tim)
        exp10 is now detected in the main cmake file, and defined as pow(10,x) in muse_math.h
         if it is NOT found. All relevant places using exp10 now have the muse_math.h
         header instead of <cmath> or "math.h".
      - Fix compile breakage if DSSI support not enabled.
        Oops, fixed scanDssiPlugins() in plugin_cache_writer.cpp and oops, removed
         duplicate "void initDSSI() {}" from alsamidi.cpp (how'd that get there?)
      - M_PI support now detected in main cmake file.
      - All inclusions of math.h and cmath have been replaced with muse_math.h
         to make muse_math.h a 'central hub' for special defines.
16.02.2019
      - Fix Issue 640: wavecanvas.cpp use QProcess not fork() et al. (Tim)
08.02.2019
      - Revert usage of QRegion stl features (too new at Qt 5.8). (Tim)
07.02.2019
      - Updated all PyQt4 based midi scripts to use PyQt5 (rj)
24.01.2019
      - Stop heartbeat timer in Audio::stop(). (Tim)
        Possible random crashes closing a song and loading another song. 
        Observed a few times in mixer strip timer handlers. Not sure how
         (it's graphics thread), but in case something during loading
         runs the event loop or something, this should at least not hurt.
21.01.2019
      - Merge from selection_fixes branch: (Tim)
      * NEW! Midi controller graphs copy/cut/paste and drag/drop:
      - See README.usage for new info about how it works.
      * Mixer strips added to Drum and Wave Editors:
      * Massive graphics, canvases, cut/copy/paste/drag/drop workover:
      - New: A few dozen lossless 'agnostic' (regardless of magnification)
         graphic routines in class View.
      - Entire graphics chain from class View all the way through to the
         editor classes has been reworked. Many lines, dots were missing etc.
      - Update regions as well as rectangles are now passed to most routines.
      - Lasso fixes: Simply drawing a large lasso rectangle can take much CPU%!
        So a new mechanism to draw a thin four-sided lasso REGION was added.
        So far added to Arranger only. CPU% is much better now.
      - Copy/cut/paste mechanism is now designed to be more WYSIWYG, to avoid
         operating unknown to user on selected items in some other out-of-view window.
      - Midi controller graphs no longer wait for sync with audio cycle upon each
         item drawn by the user. This was painfully slow with large audio buffer sizes.
19.01.2019
      - Merge pull 634 "Run properly on HiDPI screens" from hfiguiere. (Tim)
        Modified slightly, to check Qt version.
07.01.2019
      - Xml class full makeover. (Tim)
        Removed all QByteArray stuff. Now it works directly with _s1 or _s2,
         which cures concerns about deep copying the b.a. back to _s1/_s2,
         stuff which was hastily added at Qt4 to make it work.
        Tightened up several of the routines.
06.01.2019
      - Scanner: Replaced silly stdout stuff with QTemporaryFile. (Tim)
      - Class Xml now supports directly reading and writing a QIODevice
         and writing to a QString, instead of requiring a FILE*.
      - Using the above, eliminated two usages of fdopen().
06.01.2019
      - Fix plugin scanner bug reported by artofmusic in forum. (Tim)
        Some plugins may output stuff on stdout. This was confusing
         our xml scanner. So a method of separating our xml from the
         rest of stdout was added. Tested OK with LinVst and sforzando.
19.12.2018
      - Fix fluidsynth fluid_synth_error() deprecated in 2.0.2 (Tim)
      - For bug 632: Fix slight text error in Global Settings option:
         Now reads "Ctrl + right click sets left range marker".
07.11.2018
      * NEW! Safe Plugin Scanner version 2: (Tim)
      - The plugin scans are cached now, in ./config/MusE/scanner.
        This means faster startup time since it no longer has to 
         rescan each time.
      - Deicsonze and SimpleDrums MESS synths load muuuch faster
         now since each instance no longer has to scan plugins.
      - New command line option -R forces rescan.
        Also new 'Force rescan' checkbox under plugin paths tab
         in Global Settings dialog.
      - Automatically detects changes in any of the plugin paths
         given in Global Settings dialog, and rescans.
      - Added Ladspa RDF (lrdf) support. Initial support for now.
      - More major rearrangements: Moved several module libraries
         out of the muse tree into the libs tree, since they stand
         on their own.
        Created new libs folder 'plugin' containing all of the
         plugin scanning and caching code.
        Awl and AL libraries are now fully separated and isolated
         from the main app. Awl is NO LONGER linked in with the
         main app, only with the Deicsonze MESS synth. Yay.
20.10.2018
      - Oops, fix previous fix of 19.10.2018 (Tim)
        Move function_dialogs folder out to muse folder.
        Re-order the cmake subdirectory list so that things get built first.
      - Fix freeze or crash in Xml::parse() under certain conditions
         with corrupt files.
19.10.2018
      - Moved complex 'widgets' to new folder 'components'. (Tim)
        New library 'components' separated from 'widgets'.
      - Finished completely isolating libraries AL, AWL, and widgets
         so that Deicsonze and SimpleDrums MESS synths load now.
      - So things are even more modular now for less unresolved dependencies.
17.10.2018
      * NEW! Safe Plugin Scanner 'sandbox': (Tim)
      - MusE should NEVER crash due to plugin scanning at startup now!
      - All LADSPA, MESS, DSSI, and LinuxVST plugins are each scanned
         in a separate QProcess program upon MusE startup.
        Those that fail are NOT INCLUDED for further use.
        Currently the QProcess communicates back to muse via 
         an xml-encoded text on stdout.
        But this could change to shared memory.
        (Hint hint: Grow into an actual plugin run-time sandbox host!)
      - All items in globaldefs.h that were in the global namespace
         are now part of MusECore namespace, including MIDI_CHANNELS
         which was a #define.
      - Added command-line option -S (Don't load MESS plugins).
      - Fixed crash in Deicsonze: Failure to initialize lfoDelayIndex.
09.10.2018
      - Fix bug 629 by mqnc: Meta events (lyrics) not imported. (Tim)
        Lyrics + few other metas were ignored in buildMidiEventList().
11.09.2018
      - Fix compile bug 635 by Pablo Tassi: "invalid conversion from
         ‘unsigned int’ to ‘Qt::WindowType’ in vst_native.cpp at lines
         1520 and 3607. (Tim)
11.08.2018
      - New: SongChanged flags are now a structure with extra info. (Tim)
        Introducing SongChangedStruct_t. SongChangedFlags_t is now a
         member of that structure. New member 'subFlags' holds optional
         extra bits (we're running out of SongChangedFlags_t bits) which
         are intended to be a 'sub flags' NOT an extension of flags bits.
        New member 'sender' should ease a long-time problem of how to
         ignore self-generated SongChanged signals feeding back to an
         object with no way to know if they were self-sent. Unused yet...
      - Fix accidentally broken Arranger cut/paste on 07.08.2018
09.08.2018
      - Fixed compile error when using internal LV2 support. (Tim)
        System LV2 include paths were being included, taking priority,
         fixed in top CMakeLists.txt file.
      - Fixed internal LV2 lilv state.c new_state_from_model() (Tim)
        I found state->dir should be a file path, not a URI.
        Symptom: With linuxsampler LV2 plugin for example,
         the filename sent to it was wrong, it was a full URI.
        Prepared a patch for submission to LV2, pending testing the fix.
      - Fixed internal LV2 compiler warning "unneccessary parentheses"
         treated as as error in LV2 util.h LV2_ATOM_OBJECT_FOREACH, 
         LV2_ATOM_OBJECT_BODY_FOREACH, LV2_ATOM_SEQUENCE_FOREACH, 
         LV2_ATOM_SEQUENCE_BODY_FOREACH, and in lilv.h LILV_FOREACH.
07.08.2018
      - Menu cleanups, rearrangement. (Tim)
        Moved several Edit menu items to the Functions menu.
        Moved Mastertrack menu items over to View menu since they
         don't have much to do with editing tracks or parts.
        Eliminated Automation menu. Moved all those items into Audio menu,
         since they're all audio related.
        As requested: Added a Close item in the File menu. Currently it
         does NOT clear the midi devices and ports, they remain as last set.
        Added File Save As and Application Exit icons.
        Changed name of 'MusE Settings' menu to just 'Settings'.
        Added new checkbox in Appearance Settings: "Use theme icons if available",
         which activates a dormant feature of using theme icons if they are found.
05.08.2018
      - Further LV2 GUI fixes - see 29.11.2017. Fixed X11 GUI size. (Tim)
        For example DrumGizmo should open OK and not be allowed
         to shrink below its supplied size.
01.07.2018
      - Fix non-functional mouse wheel in Canvas::wheelEvent(). (Tim)
        Broke with fixes of 15.12.2017. I tried to repect what that fix did,
         hopefully works OK with either touch pad (I don't have one) or mouse wheel.
        Increased step size slightly from 40 to 50.
26.06.2018
      - More fixes for newer gcc warnings treated as errors. (Tim)
        Oops. Fixed some funny business with memcpy in DeicsOnze::initPluginDelay().
        Oops. Fixed missing switch/case breaks in Slider::setOrientation().
        Bump up required RtAudio version to 5.0 and fix wrong include statement
         in rtaudio.cpp from rtaudio.h to rtaudio/RtAudio.h
        Attempt to fix warning (error) in lilv.h: "error: unnecessary parentheses
         in declaration of ‘i’ [-Werror=parentheses]". Can't seem to suppress this,
         was forced to turn lv2host.cpp/h into a separate module with its own
         -Wno-error compile flag. Tested OK with muse built as static modules
         or normal build. Bit of a hack, could it fail if something else includes
         lv2host.h first before the module is compiled?
28.05.2018
      - Added missing #includes needed by newer Qt >= 5.11 (Orcan)
10.05.2018
      - SimplePlugin system: More improvements. (Tim)
        Various changes. Added Plugin::createPluginI().
08.05.2018
      - SimplePlugin system: Some improvements. (Tim)
        After scanning, all plugin libraries are CLOSED until instantiated.
        When all instances are freed, existing behaviour remains: Library closes.
        New class LadspaPluginI derived from PluginI which is a base class now.
        SimplePlugin system remains modular. WIP: Lv2Plugin, Lv2PluginI, others.
06.05.2018
      - SimplePlugin system: Rearranged sampleRate, add segmentSize. (Tim)
30.04.2018
      - RtAudio, dummy driver fixes if realtime scheduling NOT available. (Tim)
        Symptom: "...processTrackCtrls *** Error: evframe:123 < frame:299.."
        Cause: Two variables - time at cycle start, and frames at cycle start -
         were updated at different times in the audio device callback, causing 
         timestamp requests to be wrong.
        Cure: The variables need protection in the callbacks when no realtime
         scheduling is available. Added a 'flipping variable buffer' scheme
         where all the variables are updated at once.
      - Submitted a patch to RtAudio project, to enable realtime for Pulse.
22.04.2018
      * Fixes to Master Track functionality, and Transport mini-makeover: (Tim)
        - Fixed: Was impossible to adjust static tempo when Master Track disabled.
        - Removed superfluous tempo and sig boxes from Master Track Graphic toolbars.
        - Enabling external sync no longer forces Master Track off.
        - Added Master button to Tempo toolbar in all windows. Tempo box now obeys it.
        - Replaced Transport tempo and sig boxes with editable spinbox versions.
        - Fixed Transport controls' widths causing too-wide Transport!
        - New Transport buttons and SVG icons.
10.04.2018
      - Small important fix: Auto-connect metronome to first audio output track. (Tim)
        When a new AudioOutput track is added, it checks if it is the only one
         and auto-connects the metronome to it. Also, template files having an
         AudioOutput track have been changed. This should make metronome "just work".
08.04.2018
      * Major fixes to long-standing fundamental midi timing errors: (Tim)
      - Symptoms: Midi event times were often wrong, much worse with smaller audio
         periods. Caused jitter on almost every event, the events were booted into
         the next cycle when they should have been played in current one.
      - Floating point math has been BANISHED from ALL timing functions including
         midi, sync, wall-clock, jack time etc.
        Instead, large-integer math is used. Where 128-bit is required, the
         3rd party libdivide library is used for compatibility reasons.
        In functions which convert from a low resolution value to a high one,
         rounding-up is used (NOT round-to-nearest). For example, tick to frame
         is rounded up but NOT frame to tick. This ensures a one-to-one
         correspondence between frame and tick. Similar with MTC <-> frame calcs.
      - There was a fundamental problem with how we schedule midi events for playback,
         including metronome. We compared the midi event ticks with the current
         tranport frame range converted to ticks. This is backwards and inaccurate.
        It now converts the midi event ticks to frames and THEN compares with the
         current transport frame range. This is much more accurate and correct.
      - TESTS: Precount and metronome with a tempo of 125 or 120: Timing is perfect,
         no missed events. With a fractional tempo of 130.55: Timing is perfect,
         event times are 'decimated' (staggered) to account for the fractional part.
        With a wildly varying hand-drawn tempo map: Observed that all song bars do
         show as X.0.0 when on the bar. Was not working well before, due to losses.
      Unrelated fixes:
      - Added transport seek anti-flood mechanism. (Tim)
        Symptoms: When cursor was moved around, there would often be a 'flood' of
         repeated events as the 'snap' position competes with user-dragged position.
        A small fraction of a second delay was added after the cusrsor stops moving
         before the engine plays any more events.
      - Added precount 'Precount on play' and 'Mute metronome' features. (Tim)
        Precount on play allows precount during play mode. Mute metronome mutes
         the metronome after precount, this is handy if only precount is desired.
      - Fixed compile error when ENABLE_LV2_GTK2 is disabled. (Tim)
21.02.2018
      * PRECOUNT feature lives! : (Tim)
      - Restored dead precount feature.
      - It uses the 'slow-sync' feature of Jack Transport (and ours).
      - Moved our 'dummy' transport feature from Jack module into
         base class AudioDevice. This means ALL our drivers support it now.
      - It means ALL the drivers support precount.
      - Added README.metronome which explains a few things. Read it!
30.01.2018
      *** MusE 3.0.2 ***
29.01.2018
      - Silly but very severe bug fixed with selecting midi device for newly
        created midi tracks. Looking for the last created midi device started
        out of bounds, instant crash when built for release (rj)
28.01.2018
      - Fixes for #604: muse 3.0 fails to build: many undefined references. (Tim)
        Packagers wanted to use -no-undefined linker flag. But this also requires
         our own -DMODULES_BUILD_STATIC. The fix of 14.01.2018 fixed the main app,
         but all the MESS synths still failed to build.
        This MAJOR FIX rewrites all the plugins and some main app stuff, so that
         there are NO unaccounted dependencies and the two flags should work.
        Overview: Several complete core objects and several declarations/definitions
         were seperated from the core to their own modules or header files:
             sysex_helper_module memory_module evdata_module mpevent_module
             wavepreview_module xml_module, and midictrl_consts.h, midi_consts.h
        These modules all build SHARED regardless of MODULES_BUILD_STATIC.
        Several of the MESS synths directly used core components. Eliminated now.
        A huge remaining problem was Deicsonze synth directly used the core's
         plugin system (eek!), while SimpleDrums used its own plugin system.
        So a new common SimplePlugin library was built. It is similar to our
         main app plugin system but simplified for LADSPA, yet still has
         instance reference counting and auto-library-close.
        Both Deicsonze and SimpleDrums now use this library instead.
        (It is an interesting 'clean' plugin system from the ground up. Would be
         good to build upon this library to replace the main plugin system!)
        TODO: There is a flaw in how our plugin systems connect 2-1 or 1-2 ins/outs.
        TODO: There are still a couple of ugly but harmless dependencies, such as
         some synths depend on our widgets library but only depnd on widgets which
         don't depend on other things, and one synth depends on WavePreview.
23.01.2018
      - Added an appdata file. Distros want it these days (Orcan)
17.01.2018
      - Added ability to /not/ specify a default out, instead a created midi track
        defaults to the port with highest number (usually the last created)
        this is also the default behaviour now (rj)
16.01.2018
      *** MusE 3.0.1 ***
14.01.2018
      - Moved structure.* into muse/arranger/. -DMODULES_BUILD_STATIC=TRUE should
        work now. (Orcan)
      - Print out note name on events in Pianoroll
        possibly this should be a setting (rj)
11.01.2018
      - Fixed looping not playing first note in loops since 17.12.2017. (Tim)
        Was a line in MidiDevice::handleSeek() I was not sure of.
      - Fixed midi sustain controller problems since 17.12.2017. (Tim)
        Sustain was not handled right, and was being reset to zero.
08.01.2018
      - Fixed build against newer gcc (4.5+ with c++11 enabled) and glibc 2.27+ (Orcan)
08.01.2018
      - Oops! Fix #602 Wave tracks lose sync if muted / unmuted. (Tim)
        Slight rework of WaveTrack::getData().
        TODO: Same thing happens if clicking track off/on.
06.01.2018
      *** MusE 3.0.0 ***
        Final release of MusE 3.0.0
      - Changed remaining toLatin1() into toLocal8Bit() for fluidsynth path operations. (rj)
05.01.2018
      - Merged feature from Michael Oswald, Mid transformer support for (rj)
        randomizing event
04.01.2018
      - Fixed Zynaddsubfx LV2 not working in Muse (#599) (Tim)
        (X11UI ui type would not show after the first show, and looked ugly.)
        Used QMainWindow instead of QWindow for X11UI LV2 ui type.
        Added a flag state->uiIsOpening which forces the gui update timer
         to re-send all controls and program to the gui upon re-opening in 
         LV2PluginWrapper_Window::updateGui + LV2Synth::lv2ui_SendChangedControls.
02.01.2018
      - Fix fluidsynth not loading font although it shows valid filename. (Tim)
        Out-of-scope QString byte array constData in LoadFontWorker::execLoadFont.
01.01.2018
      - Ported QThread and removal of QSocketNotifier from
        platformindependence branch (rj)
      - Removed Gui calls from nongui thread of fluidsynth plugin (rj)
        as they caused a lockup.
        TODO: The gui calls were there to handle when a soundfont was
        not found, to be able to load an alternative. Currently
        the fonts are omitted silently, a better solution should be found.
      - fixed regression, context menu for tracks had vanished (rj)
      - Some attempts to fix 'global cut' crash. Working on it...(Tim)
      - New SVG icons for transport stop, play, ff, rew, rew-to-start. (Tim)
31.12.2017
      - As requested: Track monitor now works regardless of track mute. (Tim)
        Allows to listen to input while muting playback material.
        Note that turning a track off, or 'proxy muting' it will still
         mute the track.
      - Fix monitored midi output on wrong channel. Editing error from 17.12.2017
      - New master record icon, dual-state red LED style.
      - Missing ifdefs for RTAUDIO, build patch from Dennis Schulmeister added (rj)
      - Moved instantiation of Add Track Menu so it is only done once (rj)
29.12.2017
      - Revert some new undo stuff and replace with pending operations. (Tim)
        Undo was behaving oddly for things like mute, rec, monitor, off etc.
27.12.2017
      - Jack is now the default audio device selection. (Tim)
        If that fails, it tries rtAudio with Pulse, and if that fails,
         the dummy driver.
24.12.2017
      - Oops! Fix years-old bug preventing a just-moved part from sounding. (Tim)
        The MovePart undo/operations were not properly erasing/reinserting
         the part because they were passed null track and oldTrack.
        For ex. if a wave part was moved before another wave part, it
         looked OK on screen but it did not sound.
      - Reverted small piece of code that made song dirty too sensitive.
      - TODO: Revert a few places, causing some undo operations to be
         included in undo/redo history when they weren't meant to be.
      - Added sample-rate change according to song file when using RtAudio (rj)
        as backend.
      - Removed the RtAudioJack option, brings trouble and can't find any (rj)
        reasonable use for it.
23.12.2017
      - Some fixes to rtAudio support. (Tim)
        Fix compile error on unknown 'DummyAudio'.
        Automatically chooses nearest lower sample rate if requested
         rate is unsupported. Prevents freeze in MusE msg system.
        If driver cannot be started, it warns with a message box but MusE
         still runs so that user can change the driver.
        NOTE: If system is not set up properly, selecting Pulse backend
         while Jack is already running may cause MusE to freeze. Likewise,
         selecting Jack backend may cause Pulse to pause.
22.12.2017
      - Added backwards compatibility hack for Splitter, (atleast some) old songs
        have only two splits for the arranger, so we inject a third to mimic
        tree splits (rj)
      - RtAudio with PULSE AUDIO backend is now default. (rj)
        Rather drastic change but it should make it much easier for new users.
        TODO: Display the current audio driver somewhere in the UI
      - Harmonized audio device selection so they are all available in the
        config dialog, midi only still can be selected with -a and
        RtAudio+Pulse can be selected with -t (rj)
19.12.2017
      - Enabled basic stereo input support (rj)
      - RtAudio buffer allocation rework (rj)
      - Make RtAudio fallback instead of dummyaudio if jack isn't recognized. (rj) 
18.12.2017
      - Fixed horizontal scrolling with shift, again (rj)
      - Wired rtaudio to config dialog so backend device, buffers size
        and sample rate can be set (rj)
        TODO:
        > Add proper output port support
        > Add input ports
        > Make config changes without restart
      - backported build fixes in lilv/util.c from 0.24.2 to our version
        to allow building without deprecation warnings (by default we treat
        them as errors) (rj)
17.12.2017
      * Substantial midi engine redesign: (Tim)
         - Merge from engine_fixes_2017 branch:
         - To ease working with multiple threads, new classes were developed:
           MemoryQueue, and templates TypedMemoryPool LockFreeMPSCBuffer
            and LockFreeMPSCRingBuffer. Pooled-memory SeqMPEventList was added
            to compliment MPEventList.
         - Midi device processing is now completely de-coupled from other threads,
            using only MPSC Ring Buffers. It just does 'what it is told' now.
           There is no more 'sending back' of midi controller values from midi
            device process code to the audio thread - that was like a SERIAL manner.
           Example: Previously a keyboard sent a controller, the audio thread picked
            it up and sent it to an ALSA device where it's processed in the seq thread,
            which then sets the muse hw midi controller representing it, and finally
            the gui controls are updated with these values soon after.
           Now instead, a keyboard sends a controller, the audio thread picks it up
            and sends it in a PARALLEL manner to TWO places at once: An ALSA device
            ring buffer where it's processed in the seq thread, AND a ring buffer
            processed in the audio thread for setting the muse hw midi controller,
            and finally the gui controls are updated soon after.
           As one result, midi controls are now updated properly from automation
            graphs - independently - whether the device actually got the messages,
            or even if no device (<None>) selected for the port !
           TODO: Now that we have MPSC ring buffers, I am hoping to allow ALSA midi
            to shine, by taking midi input and bypassing the audio thread and
            'directly' talking (putting) to other devices' threads. Eventually the
            ALSA thread will 'collect' and process events completely independent
            of the audio thread, autonomously without audio buffer size related delays.
         - External midi clock sync: Complete redesign! Does not 'miss' recording
            the first few notes any more.
           There is no more pervasive 'duality' of processing midi in 'ticks' when
            externally syncing vs 'frames' for normal tempo map use when not
            externally syncing.
           Instead, a brief external clock frame timestamp history is kept, and
            ALL midi processing is done in FRAMES now, regardless of whether
            externally syncing. Yay.
         - Large System Exclusive (sysex) message support: MusE can now record
            and playback very large sysex messages. Works great with ALSA.
           TODO: Jack midi does not support large sysex recording.
         - Some fixes to the 'retake' (restart recording) feature. Complete re-write.
           Much more stable and realtime-safe now. But still slow with wave tracks.
         - All mute, solo, and off controls make the song dirty now.
         - Metronome fixes: Fixed silent metronome when any track was soloed!
           Fixed metronome dialog: Not updating when song loaded.
           Fixed non-realtime-safe reloading of metronome samples.
         - Piano and drum list: No more slow waiting for audio thread when each note played.
           Fast! Completely de-coupled by putting to the ring buffers instead.
         - Several other smaller related and unrelated fixes along the way.
         - Enhancements to midi port/device popup menu in track list + drum list. (Tim)
           Sorted by device type now.
         - New! Synthesizer tracks can change their port from the track list.
         * Initial support for RtAudio - Pulse Audio sound output (rj)
           For the moment severely limited
           - only samplerate 44100
           - only output stereo
           - no input
15.12.2017
         - Added support for track pad horizontal scrolling.
           Involved adjusting scrolling constants and moving to pixelDelta() for
           QWheelEvent, may need further adjustment (rj)
14.12.2017
         - fixed track info drawing to be drawn correctly when using big fonts (rj)
04.12.2017
         - Fixes to instruments, idf files, and sysexes. (Tim)
           Fix error in Yamaha 9000pro idf file causing
            "Cannot convert string to sysex r ct bn bt f7".
           Several submitted idf files have F0...F7 enclosing sysexes, which was not 
            allowed, so to avoid changing them all, MusE is now more forgiving and 
            accepts enclosing F0...F7 in idf files and when editing sysex events.
03.12.2017
         - PopupMenu and RoutePopupMenu fixes and touchups. (Tim)
           Fix problems with <More...> submenus.
           Sort and present midi device items by device type.
           Slight rearrangement of title items etc.
02.12.2017 
         - Clear 'recently opened' file list upon MusE self-restarting. (Tim)
01.12.2017
         - Further to 29.11.2017: Fixed LV2 synths + rack plugins position/size. (Tim)
           NOTE: AFAIK we have no control over LV2 plugin 'external' windows,
            only the ones where we create the window.
           TODO: Same fix for MESS synths...
29.11.2017
         - Bug #571 Plugin GUIs are too narrow: Fixed. (Tim)
           Fixed generic GUI windows' initial position/size.
           Fixed saving/restoring pos/size of generic GUIs. 
           Reported a Qt BUG #64773 regarding ignoring setting of position upon show()!
           For said bug, wrote a MusE workaround. Tested all generic GUIs OK. 
           TODO: Similar fix for 'native' synth GUIs (where it supports it...)
           TODO: Similar check and fix other non-QDialog usages for pos/size settings.
20.11.2017
         - Removed: Arranger 'Alt' button (and hidden Pianoroll) midi Trackinfo. (Tim)
19.11.2017
         - LV2: Fix continuous "LV2SimpleRTFifo:put(): fifo is full" messages. (Tim)
           Rewrote LV2EvBuf ctor: Can't just always call _buffer.resize() here, 
            which fills with items. Use reserve + assign(1) item for an output buffer,
            and resize for an input buffer. Some plugins expose midi output sequence 
            ports even though they do NOT use them at all. This fix cures an oversight 
            which caused our receiving buffer to always be full in such cases, never 
            having a chance to be cleared by the plugin.
         - Bug #572: Fix Alt+P crash with unselected regions. (Tim)
16.11.2017
         - LV2: Fix bug #587 All Gtk-based guis crashing on close. (Tim)
           Rewrote how we delete things on close.
05.11.2017
         - Fix #592 MusE doesn't record some controllers. (Tim)
08.06.2017
         - QString::sprintf is obsoleted. Changed most sprintf and all QString::sprintf to 
            QString::arg usage or similar code, or snprintf. Compiler warned of some suspicious 
            sprintf usage with not enough dest space. Fixed a few other compiler complaints. (Tim)
         - lv2Gtk2Support module: Build with -Wno-error to avoid stopping on warnings. (Tim)
         - Track list: Fix double error message box on track rename with duplicate name. (Tim)
06.06.2017
         - More frozen MDI sub windows fixes. (Tim)
           When style or stylesheet is changed in Appearance, warning now is 'changes don't
            take effect until restarted'. Don't even attempt to set style/stylesheet if user 
            answers no to self-restart prompt. Moved initial setup of style/stylesheet in main() 
            from after muse->show to just after QApplication is created - now the only 
            place allowed to set them, except for hacks if 'Fix frozen windows' setting is on.
           Note: Setting a stylesheet may still cause it to freeze. Working on the issue...
         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         [EDIT]: 29/11/2017 The 'frozen MDI sub window' thing was a KDE Breeze/Oxygen style bug. 
                 Fixed upstream in recent versions with help from that team.
         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
03.06.2017
      * GCC 7 fixes: (Tim)
         - LV2 GTK2 support is now optional, due to a current exception breakage in gtkmm.
         - Fixed many places using switch/case 'fallthrough'. With gcc7 these now generate 
            warnings which MusE treats as errors. I used 'comment warning suppressor indicators':
            // FALLTHROUGH
         - Fixed slight de-referencing problem in JackAudioDevice::portName().
26.05.2017
         - Further to 22.05: [Sigh] More timer fixes: (Tim)
           Info: Alsa HR timer now has hard-coded 1000 Hz limit, unsettable, unreadable :-o
           As recommended by ALSA support, step through and try freqs as before.
           Fixed div by 0 crash in ALSA timer if freq too high - set ticks to 1 if 0.
           In view of the above, the RTC timer now takes priority. MusE tries it first,
            and falls back to ALSA (typically the HR timer or else the system timer).
           Updated README with modern info about setting up systems for timers.
         - Bug #567 from Krzysztof Gajdemski: Older Qt: Build fails at QMetaObject::inherits().
           Oops, remove line. Next line qobject_cast() will take care of it.
22.05.2017
         - Oops, fix ALSA timer fix of 14.05 not working. (Tim)
           From kernel 4.4.0-77, some weird default 1000Hz limit on HR timer frequency!
           Step through several frequencies looking for the best one.
21.05.2017
         - More mixer strip focus tabbing fixes, including strip-to-strip. Should be OK now. (Tim)
20.05.2017
         - Oops, fix midi meters when midi sliders are in dB mode. (Tim)
14.05.2017
         - Some work on ALSA timer. For ex. not working at all in openSuSE. (Tim)
           TODO: More tests. Cleanups. Remove diagnostic printf's.
13.05.2017
         - More frozen MDI windows fixes: (Tim)
           Added option "General Settings > Gui Behaviour > Fix frozen MDI sub windows".
           Move the theme and style stuff in MusE::changeConfig() into a separate
            MusE::updateThemeAndStyle(). Many places call changeConfig, but only
            a couple really needed updateThemeAndStyle().
           TODO: Benign XCB connection errors may still occur. Remove diagnostic printf's.
24.04.2017
         - Added Monitor track list column. (Tim)
         - Streamlined and tightened up the record-arm and bounce operations. (Tim)
         - Monitor on record-arm is on by default now, upon first installation. (Tim)
         - Fixed a problem with arranger track resizing taking much too long with
            many tracks and mixer open - added a separate SC_TRACK_RESIZED. (Tim)
         - Bumped up songfile version to 3.1, so that incompatible binary header data
            can be skipped, since a new Monitor column was added. Changed other files. (Tim)
10.04.2017
         - Slight tweak: Don't allow the strips to gain focus. (Tim)
         - Added new Czech translation from Pavel Fric. (Tim)
08.04.2017
         - Crash fix: File > New > Audio.med > change wave track 1 to stereo -> crashes soon after. (Tim)
           In AudioTrack::copyData(): In two sections concerning '2ch' -> '1ch' mixing: Move 'sp' inside
            channel loop. Was allowed to increment beyond, into other variable data, causing silent corruption.
         - Also, fixed template "audo.med": Both audio output track's outputs were routed to same jack port. (Tim)
         - Slightly simpler track list solo icons. (Tim)
04.04.2017
      * More routing and mixer relief: (Tim)
         - New: As requested: Monitor on Record Arm option. Right click any strip, or Global Settings.
         - New: Mixer strip volume/pan affect multiple selected tracks. Works fully with midi <-> audio strips.
           Works in mixer and arranger, but purposely NOT in pianoroll to avoid accidental changes to other tracks.
           Tally of things that currently can operate on multiple selected tracks:
               Track list: Channel, port, mute, solo. Strip: Volume, pan, routing buttons.
         - New: Strip keyboard focusing and operations: All strip controls now accept keyboard
            focus. Strip volume box is now the default PROXY focus for all strips. Any strip control
            having focus can be adjusted with up/down keys. Regardless of who has focus,
            volume and pan always can be adjusted with universal keys.
            Keys:              Up/down: Adjust any focused control.
                         Alt + Up/down: Adjust volume regardless of focused control.
                      Alt + Left/right: Adjust pan regardless of focused control.
               Ctrl + Alt + Left/right: Switch to a neighbouring strip.
                                Escape: "Get me out of this focused control to something higher-level!"
                                        (Back to the arranger canvas, or the mixer window.)
         - New: Show midi volume as dB option. Right click any strip, or Global Settings.
         - To achieve midi volume as dB and support inter-strip increments, class MidiCtrlValList hwVal
            member type was changed from INT to DOUBLE. Was required to support fractional increments.
         - New: Midi strip instrument and patch labels respond to enter/return key to open popup menu.
         - New: As requested: Strip name labels: Double-click to edit track name, or right-click context menu.
         - New: Strips: 'Tabs' hold palettes of controls. Extra controls have been moved there from right.
           The tabs accept keyboard focus and can be activated by hitting return/enter or clicking.
         - Fixed: Yay! Finally the strip volume boxes have proper focus and mouse-over rectangles.
           There is a dumb problem with KDE Oxygen and Breeze themes: They turn off ALL such rectangles
            if the widget-to-font height ratio is too small. This required a HACK to force the
            rectangles to be drawn. Fixed with new class LineEdit, now is base of class DEntry.
         - Fixed: Strip labels now show colour with a stylesheet active. Looks good with dark stylesheets.
           It was a problem with the order and way in which stylesheets were set. (And they override
            fonts, so you can't SET then READ a widget font, it always returns what the stylesheet set.)
         - Fixed: Strip volume scale drawing was offset too much to the left sometimes.
         - Several other fixes along the way.
16.03.2017
         - Draw the frame around all mixer strips. (Tim)
15.03.2017
      * Routing and mixer relief: (Tim)
         - Fixed auto-connect routing: Midi tracks by default now only connect to the first
            suitable midi port input or output instead of all of them at once.
         - Multi-selected tracks editing: New: Routing buttons apply to ALL selected tracks
            ie. select two or more tracks and the routing buttons apply to each track.
           The selected tracks must be type-compatible. TODO: All other strip controls.
         - Added some SVG icons: Mixer window now scales almost perfectly to chosen font.
           Moved 'Monitor' button to between 'Off' and 'Rec arm' buttons.
         - New class IconButton replaces clumsy ToolButton and icon usage. Has TWO different
            icon groups, perfect for our 'proxy' solo and mute.
         - All mute buttons now show 'proxy' mute ie. when any OTHER track is soloed.
         - All 'Monitor' buttons are now off by default.
      * Bug fixes:
         - Fixes for 'frozen' Arranger not responding:
           NEW! Changing theme style in Appearance dialog automatically restarts MusE.
           If a stylesheet is chosen, 'style' is forced to 'Fusion' for now until fixed upstream.
         - Fixed duplicate events: From multiple tracks connected to the same inputs and output
            if 'Monitor' was active. Protection from same-time events (only) in MPEventList::add().
         - Fixed: Track ordering incorrect after deleting multiple tracks then undoing.
         - Fixed: Big CPU % spikes when clicking almost anything in the mixer window.
           Excessive redrawMixer() calls: Fix some controls/strip mouse handling: Accept, not ignore.
           New specific SC_TRACK_MOVED flag replaces the more general SC_TRACK_MODIFIED when
            moving tracks in Arranger or Mixer, and filter out other flags causing redrawMixer().
16.02.2017
         * Recording from synthesizer midi output supported: (Tim)
         - All synths are now marked as both readable/writable.
         - Synths can now be selected as a midi input route.
         - Received events from a synth will absolutely NOT be echoed back to the
            SAME synth instance under any circumstances, even if 'monitor' button is on.
         - Recording: buildMidiEventList(): Added protection from duplicate events
            sent by certain broken plugins or malformed midi import files.
           (Our 'live stuck notes' mechanism already protects from playing 'live' duplicate notes.)
         - If output port's instrument has no note-off mode, do not use our 'live stuck notes'
            mechanism. This allows for example drum trigger input devices sending NO note-offs,
            although you must first select an instrument having no note-off mode.
14.01.2017
         - Drum editor list: Added 'Set field', 'Set row', 'Set list' to right-click menu. (Tim)
13.01.2017
         - Replaced midi editors' control panel knob with compact knob and LCD patch editor. (Tim)
           Both use the 'waitless' method of 09.01.2017.
         - Improvements to compact knob look and functionality. (Should look OK with 8pt font now.)
         - Clear focus after LCD patch edit popup editor closes. FIXME There are three sections,
            need to clear focus for now, we can't really have focus hanging around there for the
            unaware user - need to add a section 'hilighter/selector'.
09.01.2017
         - FIXED: Midi strip controls much too slow with large audio (Jack) period. (Tim)
         - Created and installed new template class 'LockFreeBuffer<T>' to replace clumsy
            per-type / fixed capacity multiple implementations. Works with ANY type, and
            capacity can be set per-instance.
         - Replaced 'waiting' calls of midi strip controls, with the new LockFreeBuffer<T>.
           Midi controls are now fast and smooth, like audio controls, even at high Jack periods.
         - TODO: Fix midi controller graphs much too slow as well!
07.01.2017
         * New - Monitoring feature: (Tim)
         - Midi Tracks and Wave Tracks have a 'Monitor' button.
           Push to pass input through to output.
           Midi Track 'Midi Thru' was re-branded and re-purposed as 'Monitor'.
         - Meters: When in 'rec-arm' mode but not 'Monitor', meters are active.
           Wave Tracks: NOTE: Be aware that when 'rec-armed', the meters show
            the RECORDING levels pre-fader/rack etc. NOT post-fader.
           This was a technical necessity, but actually has benefits: The user
            can see the actual recording levels before the signal hits the disk.
         - Since monitoring is important and can cause unaware unwanted mixing or
            missing audio, the 'Monitor' buttons flash to indicate being active.
         - TODO: Add an Arranger track list 'Monitor' column.
                 Make Wave Tracks NOT monitor by default ??
         - FIXED: Wave tracks now mix playback audio with incoming audio -
                   you can now hear what's playing as you are recording.
21.12.2016
         - Make some cmake system commands friendlier. (Tim)
         - Remove some more old setuid stuff.
20.12.2016
         - Removed libuuid dependency. Replaced with QUuid. (Tim)
           Tested OK copying and pasting/cloning parts and notes (places using uuids).
18.12.2016
         * ALSA support is now OPTIONAL ! :
         * MusE can now be built as a PURE Jack application:
         - Also fixed some problems with various config combinations of DSSI, liblo, and ALSA support.
           Note: The smaller DSSI ALSA Compatibility package is NOT suitable for our DSSI support. (Tim)
17.12.2016
         * Eliminated midi sequencer thread when ALSA midi driver is not enabled: (Tim)
           When 'ALSA' button is not clicked in midi config dialog, MusE is running PURE Jack,
            ie no sequencer thread (midiSeq), and no timer. Pure Jack.
16.12.2016
         - Bug #520 by asbaklm: "Muse fails to start, produces stack smashing error": (Tim)
           Further to Bug #548 fix 09.11.2016:
           (Very old RTC timer was still causing it to crash upon the resolution request ioctl.)
           Did looong overdue ALSA timer code rewrite. Picks best timer such as 1,000,000,000Hz HR Timer.
         - ALSA Timer is now checked and chosen first over the RTC timer. RTC could still be chosen
            as a LAST resort. Apparently RTC works OK for some users (not using DrumGizmo?).
15.12.2016
         - Update: Fluidsynth MESS plugin GUI updates the song's maps when
            soundfonts are removed or the channel or drum column is changed. (Tim)
         - Besides drum patches, note sample names are now cached for ALL melodic
            patches as well, they can be obtained although nothing uses them yet. (Tim)
14.12.2016
         * New - Fluidsynth MESS synth plugin automatically shows correct drum note names: (Tim)
         - No more manually loading a drum map file ;-)
         - Load up some SoundFont(s) in the plugin, and try it out. Works with multiple
            SoundFonts in different channels (be sure to mark 'drum' column).
         - Automatically looks for libinstpatch-1.0 (from Swami) and uses if found.
         - Door is open for our Instrument Editor to allow PER-CHANNEL drum maps,since
            the system supports it now. You could add it manually to .idf files for now.
         - TODO: Remove (L) (R) etc. from name strings. ie. find a better way to make
            reasonable names out of multi-sample notes.
           Does not update maps yet when fonts removed. Please toggle the track channel
            or some other way force a map update manually for now.
         - Thanks to Swami author 'Element Green' for help.
11.12.2016
         - LV2 Synth Tracks: Fixed patch not changing when patch list popped up. (Tim)
           Was simple change to include QVariant::UInt in *::patchPopupActivated().
10.12.2016
         - Fixed lingering Arranger bug not restoring size properly on project reload. (Tim)
09.12.2016
         * More 'New drum' track fixes. 'Old drums' invisible now, going soon: (Tim)
         - Midi Instrument Editor: A default Patch Number is allowed now
            (HBank = LBank = Prg = don't care). See GM instr for ex.
           ALL drum map items are editable now including Hide, Mute, Channel, Port, Anote.
           When 'Save' is clicked, song is updated immediately with changes to the instrument.
         - Drum Tracks: Added Track Drum Map overrides. Right-click any map item to see options.
           Channel, Port and ANote can be edited now.
         - Added a standard GM drum map to our GM instrument, on the default patch (see above).
         - Old midi export bug: Some controllers not exported! My typo: Changed 0x1000 to 0x10000
            in exportmidi.cpp:addController().
         - Midi Import/Export Dialog: Added two options for how drum controllers should be exported,
            see their tooltips/whatsthis for more detailed info:
              Apply drum map Port, Channel and ANote overrides
              Drum map channel overrides go to a separate track
         - Automatic conversion of loaded projects to use new drum tracks instead of old.
           Warning: The project will be SAVED with NEW drum tracks!
         - Old drum tracks hidden now. Will be removed later since they are no longer needed.
09.11.2016
         - Bug #548 by funkmuscle: New DrumGizmo version 0.9.11 causes crash. (Tim)
           Removed seteuid()/setreuid() code supporting ancient givertcap tool (kernel privileges).
           Was interfering with DrumGizmo's use of semaphores.
           TODO: Remove further old rtcaps code such as main.cpp:getCapabilities().
           Tested OK so far, with self- or externally- started Jack, or dummy audio driver,
            and as root user as well, and with Jack running non-realtime.
           Note: This may also prevent things like our RTC timer code from accessing the RTC
            as non-root, but RTC is old and should be replaced anyway, and it usually required
            'poking' it beforehand in a terminal anyway - unless MusE is run as root which still
            works as always.
30.09.2016:
         * A fix for 'New drum' tracks!:
         - Drum maps were not being updated according to track's current port and channel,
            and current state of program controller. So a hook into the global heartbeat timer
            was added and all drum maps are updated if necessary. Tested OK so far with
            multiple parts open in Drum Editor, and changing various ports, channels, and patches.
           NOTE: This means the Drum List can, and will, CHANGE DYNAMICALLY for example
            with more than one program change in a part, or simply dialing in a new port, channel
            or patch numer! TODO: Test + fix/improve/optimize more, and remove debugging messages. (Tim)
29.09.2016:
         *** MusE 3.0.0pre2 ***
           Second prerelease of MusE 3.0.0

         - Bug #526 by jphaenlin: Crash on cut with scissors while master open. (Tim)
           Seems old: In class MidiEditor: _pl (parts list) can be NULL, so protect the rest of the code.
28.09.2016:
         - Completed Robert's mixer strip selection + keyboard navigation features. (Tim)
           Now works in BOTH mixers A and B. Tested OK all functions.
           Use the arrow keys and ctrl and shift to navigate strips and adjust volume and pan.
25.09.2016:
         - Midi ports/synths configuration dialog: Allow multiple selections in device list. (Tim)
24.09.2016:
         - Anti-alias the small routing channel circles. (Tim)
23.09.2016:
         * Revenge of the knobs!:
         - Complete re-design of mixer strips, reinstating knobs but much smaller and compact. (Tim)
         - Switchable between knobs and sliders, via Global Settings or via right clicking any mixer strip. (Tim)
         - Also switchable value display, to minimize clutter.
         - Replaced clumsy three-slider midi patch editor with single-line custom LCD editor. (Tim)
17.08.2016:
         - Bug by Martin Drautzburg: ALSA Midi controllers not working. (Tim)
         - Bugs by Michael Oswald: Change 3 delete to delete[]. In LV2Synth ctor, free _nPname later. (Tim)
03.08.2016:
         - Merged fix for bug where configuration storage had stopped working, from AndreeeCZ (rj)
         - Updated templates to 3.0 (rj)
         - Fixed color-theme switching no longer working (rj)
         - Added another idf from Dennis Schulmeister, for Yamaha Motif XS (rj) 
27.06.2016:
         - Added instrument definition files from Dennis Schulmeister for:
            * Korg Krome (Bank Map KORG).idf
            * Korg Krome (Bank Map GM2).idf
            * Roland-MT32.idf
            * Lexicon-MX200.idf
            * Yamaha-Rex50.idf
20.06.2016:
         - Added connection between arranger and mixer so selecting a track carries over to the
           mixer. Mostly a visual queue but some keyboard navigation and editing is possible (rj) 
19.06.2016:
         - Removed XML printout that warned of malformed xml, mostly due to the parser being
           incomplete, still prints the warning when debug is enabled and when we are reasonably
           sure it's wrong. (rj)
         - Added keyboard navigation between strips in mixer. Ctrl+left/right to move between
           strips. Up/Down to change volume slider (TODO add pan left/right) (rj)
         - Strips can also be selected with clicking and ctrl+clicking to select more than
           one. (TODO select strips from arranger too and allow to move all selected strips)(rj)
16.06.2016:
         - Removed the ability to delete strips from the mixer, atleast temporarily, as it was
           crashing (rj)
02.06.2016:
         - Rolled back transport icons to previous version (the new version looked bad with some themes)
           and made a new rec icon (rj)
30.05.2016:
         - LV2: Fix playback crash with certain midi event times, in LV2SynthIF::getData(). (Tim)
         - Midi file export: Added missing Aftertouch, PolyAftertouch support! (Tim)
28.05.2016:
         - LV2, LinuxVST: Fixed Aftertouch, PolyAftertouch, Pitch improper composition. (Tim)
         - LV2: Fixed sending redundant program changes with every small seek. (Tim)
         - LV2, DSSI: Support 16384 Banks, arranged as two 8-bit-wide, 7-bit High and Low Bank values. (Tim)
         - Thanks to Will Godfrey for reporting and testing with yoshimi.
21.05.2016:
         - Fixed bug with ctrl+rightclick resize of notes no longer working (rj)
         - Fixed shortcut for Pointer tool in right click tool menu (rj)
20.05.2016:
         - Fixed bug with reversed Input/Output hidden in mixer menu (rj)
19.05.2016:
         - Upon startup, Jack midi inputs/outputs are (finally) now paired together 
            into single MidiDevices just like the ALSA MidiDevices. (Tim)
           How it works: If the DIFFERENCE between two Jack midi port names are EXACTLY
            the words "capture" and "playback", or "input" and "output", or "in" and "out", 
            or finally "c" and "p", then the ports are considered a matched pair. 
           (The best names or aliases are picked, "system:" are avoided, similar to our 
            persistent port routes feature.) 
16.05.2016:
         - Updated lv2Support tree to latest versions. (Tim)
           Instructions on how to do future upgrades added to lv2Support/ChangeLog.
         - Added new cmake option 'ENABLE_LV2_SUPPLIED', to use supplied vs. system
            lv2 support libraries (lv2, lilv, serd, sord, sratom etc). Default off. (Tim)
         - Removed pre-built lv2Gtk2Helper libraries and folder. (Tim)
           Replaced with lv2Gtk2Support folder, always built by cmake.
           * Thus, GTK2 dev packages gtkmm-2, gtk+-2 are now REQUIRED for LV2 Gtk2 UI support.
         - Fix compile stoppage warning if using Jack-1. The very old 'case 4: hack' in
            processSync and JackAudioDevice::getState(). (Tim)
         - Suppress unwanted Jack info terminal output. (Tim)
13.05.2016:
         - Added instrument file for Classic Cantabile SP-250 / Medeli SP4200 from 
           Mariotte91 at fontenay.tk (rj)
29.04.2016:
         *Important bug fix: About two dozen CORRUPT usages of QByteArray::constData(). (Tim)
           In: routepopup.cpp lv2host.cpp helper.cpp dssihost.cpp jackmidi.cpp conf.cpp
            vst_native.cpp minstrument.cpp
           Symptoms could vary wildly. On my system MusE refused to load the config file.
         - Fixed compile stoppage due to latest Jack obsoleting jack_port_set_name(). (Tim)
           Created 'dlopen' function pointers for jack_port_set_name() and the brand new 
            jack_port_rename(), and arbitrated between them.
         - Disable ElidedLabel auto-font size for now (midi strip instrument/patch labels). (Tim)
22,04.2016:
         *** MusE 3.0.0pre1 ***
           First prerelease of MusE 3.0.0
21.04.2016:
         - New: Accu-Slider: All sliders support 'shift' control for single-stepping 
           even with thin sliders. (Tim)
           The shift control changes from 'coarse' to 'fine' adjustment mode so
           you can zero-in on an exact value even with very short sliders.
14.04.2016:
         - Added missing Aux slider and Midi Program slider Appearance colours. (Tim)
         - Complete rewrite of 13.04.2016. Non-modal colour chooser, fully interactive. (Tim)
         - Do not save part colour names in colour configuration files. (Tim)
13.04.2016:
    * New - Live colour editing and Colour Chooser Dialog in Appearance Settings:  (Tim)
        - All target colours are updated live in realtime. With functional Apply, Cancel, and OK.
12.04.2016:
        - Implement meter colours from appearance settings. (Tim)
        - Finish default colour scheme. (Tim)
        - Fix obvious crash when loading another song: Do not connect songChanged()
           directly to Arranger and Pianoroll trackinfo's Strips. Instead, the Strips'
           songChanged() is called by Arranger and Pianoroll. (Tim)
11.04.2016:
    (By Tim:)
        - Completed (mostly) work on arranger, trackinfo, strip makeovers.
    * New Appearance Settings:
        - Several new 'Mixer' colour settings: Sliders, gain, pan, aux etc.
        - New: Load and save colour settings. Share or backup your custom colours!
        - New: Aliased small fonts for certain controls (brighter, sharper!), 
                with adjustable on/off size in Settings.
    * New audio/midi mixer strip 'Component Rack' system, streamlined and unified:
        - Configurable controllers, properties, and other selectable 'components'.
        - Not quite ready yet, user-configurability hidden for now...
    * New UI control functions:
        - All descendants of SliderBase (Slider, CompactSlider, Knob, ThinSlider etc)
           now support three adjustments 'modes':
              Normal:  Control moves with mouse.
                Jump:  Holding ctrl/middle mouse button jumps immediately to the value.
            No-track:  Holding meta changes the value only when mouse is released.
        - Reworked automation rec/play functions to fully support these modes.
    * Bug fixes:
        - New: Discrete trackinfo panel parts have been replaced with a 
                unified class TrackInfoWidget, where classes WidgetStack, Scrollbar,
                and TrackInfoLayout are combined into one widget.
               Undesirable recursive things in the previous layout have been minimized
                by using this container to hold everything.
        - Full rework: Bottom area of arranger: Caused runaway width in some cases!
          TODO: Drum editor has a similar sizing problem, difficult to shrink sometimes.
        - Reworked Global and Appearance Settings dialogs to be smaller.
        - Some other small fixes.
06.04.2016:
         - Fixed show/hide menu choices in mixer for strips (rj)
         - Remember last mixdown directory (rj)
24.03.2016:
         - Changed lilv/lib.c: lilv_lib_open(): Added RTLD_DEEPBIND to dlopen() call. (Tim)
           Fixes at least two Qt4-based external-ui synths (synthv1, drumk) crashing.
           See corresponding UI dlopen call in LV2Synth::lv2ui_ShowNativeGui() 
            for a similar fix and test results (better but the UI still CRASHES here).
           No other such plugins were found, in order to test this fix further...
         - LV2: Fix very slow right-click synth 'presets' menu with many items (ex. amsynth). (Tim)
21.03.2016:
        * New Plugin Path editor in Global Settings: (Tim)
          The LADSPA_PATH DSSI_PATH VST_PATH LINUX_VST_PATH and LV2_PATH environment variables
           are now read only ONCE upon first-time run, to fill the Global Settings boxes.
          Afterwards these variables are SET (internally) by MusE at each startup, from the 
           paths in the Global Settings boxes, so that the various plugin systems can find plugins.
          (Actually, LV2 /required/ setting LV2_PATH since we use the recommended lilv_world_load_all,
           and there doesn't seem to be any other way to set the paths programmatically in that case.)
        - Updated -h help text to reflect changes.
21.03.2016:
        - LV2 fix: Support PowerOf2BlockLength - Was missing! Supports more plugins! (Tim)
        - LV2 fix: Support FixedBlockLength - Our process routines weren't respecting this! (Tim)
                   If any controller input was adjusted, a plugin would 'gurgle' or might soon CRASH.
        - LV2: Add debugging output (-D option) while discovering plugins. (Tim)
        - LV2: Report if a plugin is ignored due to any unsupported 'required feature'. (Tim)
        
          Tested OK! With MOD Pitch Shifter series of plugins (they require fixed-block AND power-of-2).
          At both 1024 and 128 block size, these plugins' controllers responded smoothly, both with
           rapid manual adjustment and graphs, and did not 'gurgle' and did not crash after much abuse.
           
19.03.2016:
        - Fix toolbars initial positions in all windows. They were all on one line. (Tim)
          Our shared toolbar system can now use a toolbar's objectName to /replace/ 
           an existing toolbar, in MusE::setCurrentMenuSharingTopwin().
          This keeps common toolbars in-place (by default) in all the windows, 
           especially as applied to the Main Window and the Arranger.
        - Rebuild Tempo Signature and CPU toolbars to allow shrinking. (Tim)
        - Fix problems with arranger minimum size and saving/restoring window sizes. (Tim)
14.03.2016:
        * Arranger Track Info panel makeover: (Tim)
        - Add midi strip (finally!)
        - Add splitter handle for resizing the panel (finally!) 
        - Add 'Alt' button to switch between midi strip and old midi track info.
        - TODO: Splitter initial default sizing issues. Saving/reloading should be OK though.
                Also maybe some crashes. Massive cleanups. 
12.03.2016:
        - Fix routing popup menus consuming all CPU power upon mouse movement. (Tim)
          In RoutePopupMenu::event(), removed "case QEvent::MouseMove". Seems to test OK without it.
11.03.2016:
        - Make it slightly easier to recompile lvGtk2Helper library: Separate 32/64 bit makefiles
           and automatic cmake choosing of user-compiled over pre-built version. (Tim)
09.03.2016:
        - Converted python scripts to python3 and explicitly launch with python3 (rj)
        - Fixed focus issue with running scripts, if launched from an editor, the editor
          would be pushed back behind the arranger (rj)
08.03.2016:
        - Project dialog put focus on name (rj)
        - Punch in recording now works better when recording is started after the punch point. Live wave recording doesn't seem
          to work though. (rj)
07.03.2016:
        - Pianoroll: Make midi strip vertical scrollbar appear to the RIGHT of the strip, not intrude into strip. (Tim)
          Similar to how arranger trackinfo scrollbar works. Much harder than it sounds: 
           Added new custom trackinfo_layout module. Moved class ScrollBar into its own module. Added Splitter::setPosition().
        - Fix regression in MusE::readPart() causing not to re-open saved open midi editors. (Tim)
01.03.2016:
        - Fix remaining audio engine bug from 31.10.2015: Certain routing conditions produced garbage audio output, 
           and pinned channel meters. (Tim)
          Fairly substantial re-write of AudioTrack::copyData(), ::getData() and variants, especially input routing.
          Removed AudioTrack::addData(). Cleanups of massive comments etc. Test OK with many multi-channel scenarios.
26.02.2016:
        - Save state of: Routing preferredRouteNameOrAlias and routerGroupingChannels, 
           and routing dialog button routerExpandVertically. (Tim)
25.02.2016:
        Plugin generic UI fixes, new features: (Tim)
        - New: Class Meter now has orientation: Horizontal or Vertical.
        - New: Class Meter now has scale markings (just like class Slider).
        - Fix bug #470: Built-in MusE UI (such as LADSPA TAP Reverberator) not responding to controls.
        - Replaced plugin generic UI ThinSlider with Slider.
        - New: Plugin generic UI sliders have scale markings.
        - Fixed backwards plugin generic UI output meters: Replaced VerticalMeter with Meter,
           and enabled meter scale markings.
        - Removed class ThinSlider and VerticalMeter from cmake build (but not from project).
        - Related: Mixer strip volume sliders: Reinstate a 'thumb' knob.
24.02.2016:
        - Remember the state of ALSA button in Midi Configuration dialog. (Tim)
          It is a global setting, not per-song.
22.02.2016:
        Merge from midi_engine_fixes branch: (Tim)
        - Added MidiTrack 'stuck notes' and 'stuck live notes' lists and support.
          For better handling of stuck notes for example when muted or rec-arm turned off.
        - Split 'stuck notes' handling between devices and tracks.
        - Removed midi instruments 'null parameters' setting, moved into General Settings midi tab as 
           'Send null parameters' checkbox, default is off. Removed the setting from all .idf files.
        - Added General Settings midi tab 'Optimize controllers' (don't send dupl params or values). Default off.
        - Finished note-off / zero-velocity work of 13.01.2016 (it required the live stuck notes list above).
        - Apply midi track velocity/compression settings (and drum volume) to note-offs, not just note-ons.
        - Removed 'curProg' members from SynthI, and no longer read or saved in song.
          Replaced with MidiOutputParams struct in class MidiDevice. It holds current banks and prog, 
           and current (N)RPN parameters and data, to faciltate the 'Optimize controllers' setting above.
          The current program settings for all channels are still stored in the song's MidiPort controllers.
        - Added class MidiEncoder to handle all midi controller input encoding. (WIP)
        - Added more latency functions to track and effects rack. (WIP)
17.02.2016:
        (By Tim)
        - Audio automation graphs fixes:
        - Greatly reduced CPU usage while playing and graph(s) showing. 
          (Update only required rectangles and paint only requested rectangles - not the whole darn window.)
        - Fixed flickering when moving mouse.
        - Added drawing layers: Draw lines, then vertices, then text. With moderate transparency.
        - Added shaded box for text, to stand out better.
        - Vertex selection: Guaranteed to be able to select a vertex even in densely crowded multiple graphs.
        - New vertices: Guaranteed to be able to add vertices to lines even in densely crowded multiple graphs.
          Note that preference is now given to selecting/moving existing vertices over adding new ones.
          The vertex 'hit' zone is such that if you really wanted to add another vertex to an already dense 
           graph portion, then you should zoom in more.
        - Undo system fix in Undo::merge_combo():
              if (this->combobreaker || other.combobreaker)  // Flawed? 
              if (other.combobreaker)                        // Changed. Test OK.
        - Audio automation graphs: Added Undo support. Smart Undo support using the above Undo fix.
          Dragging a vertex around makes only ONE Undo step.
          This is the first real 'editing' usage of Smart Undo using Florian's combo/breaker system.
          Score Editor uses it for undo-able note selection. But there was a bug where it required two undo clicks,
           and the above Undo fix seems to cure it now, one click only.
          Another good example of Smart Undo usage (TODO): Editing the Track List channel column.
12.02.2016:
        - Added instrument definition for Yamaha S30/S80 made by Dennis Schulmeister (rj)
09.02.2016: 
        (By Tim)
        - Non-shared event lists followup: Wave event sndfile handles are now truly
           unique - overlapping multiple compressed audio file instances will play 
           now instead of halting MusE.
          TODO: When a wave part is edited, ensure other instances' caches are updated.
          Note: The master sndfile list is now meaningless. (It now allows MULTIPLE instances of SAME wave file.)
                It will either soon be REMOVED, or embellished/re-purposed. As will the Clip List Editor. 
                It is kept for now, so that the Clip List Editor can help debug what is going on.
        - Fixed crashes when using wave editing functions. Possibly fixes recording spikes too?
        - Close or re-open sndfiles in deleted or undeleted wave tracks/parts/events.
        - Fixed part copying in Duplicate Tracks function. Dialog added new modes.
        - Revert old: Do not auto-snap newly recorded wave parts to the grid. (Importing never did this.)
        - Streamlined some complex multi-cycle operations (stopRolling, recordStop, deleteTracks etc.) 
           into single undoable operation lists (one cycle).
        - Eliminated the (very old) brief total audio dropout on transport stop or rec stop.
        - Fixed the (very old) audio FIFO underrun copious errors, at song load then play.
        - Added undo of recorded audio automation controller events.
        - Good speed ups to midi sustain controller real-time stop/start disabling/reenabling loops.
          (Rearranged the loops - it was iterating all 200 ports x 16 channels).
        - Still some related finishing work to do...
07.02.2016:
        - Added widgets dependency on instruments, liste and deicsonze targets (Orcan)
06.02.2016:
        - Fixed wave writing corruption when realtime wavedrawing was enabled (rj)
        - Arm all selected tracks in the arranger when clicking REC (rj)
29.01.2016:
        - add shortcuts for mute tracks (SHIFT+m) and solo tracks (SHIFT+S) (rj)
28.01.2016:
        - print DSP load in CPU toolbar
        - allow gain in channelstrip to attenuate also (rj)
25.01.2016:
        - added midi drum name to simpledrums sample config (rj)
22.01.2016:
        - raise config dialogs after apply to keep them visible (rj)
        - removed startSong from the config in the default case 
          as we already know what should be there (rj)
        - Pianoroll/drum editor: Ensure new events are selected. (Tim)
        - Refix: Midi import empty tracks: Small revert. Test OK with user-supplied broken/fixed .mid (Tim)
21.01.2016:
        - Midi import: Ignore empty tracks with zero data. Fixed corruption if so. (Tim)
        - Midi import/export: Delete allocated memory.
      *New: Midi export now has 'Use running status', and the instr/mode + port/device 
             metas can now be turned off for a 'cleaner' file.
        - New wavedrawing mode (set to default) with drawing only a tiny outline of the wave (rj)
        - DidYouKnow dialog now allows multiline help texts (rj)
        - Several of the colors written to the config were not properly read back, now fixed (rj)
        - Fix drum editor: In Canvas::findCurrentItem: Selecting notes required 2 clicks, 
           this also fixes dragging of selected same-time notes not dragging correct notes. (Tim)
20.01.2016:
        - Fixed mixer crash when deleting track in updateStripList. (Tim)
        - Fixed audio rack plugin problems: From README.effects-rack:
            "For mono tracks with plugins having more than one audio input or output,
              MusE uses the first input or output and ignores the rest."
          This was not happening. It was using the second output. Fixed.
          Optimization: When changing track channels: Previously we deleted all rack plugin 
           instances and rebuilt them. Now it only deletes or rebuilds what is necessary.
          Fixed: A good side effect of the above is that rack plugin GUIs no longer 
           disappear when changing track channels :-)
          Fixed: Multiple-instance plugin GUIs were being updated from the last instance's
           control values. Now they are updated from the first instance (ie. 'left').
        - Arranger fixes: Fixed problems with channel unwanted double increments. 
          Fixed problems with popup editors, click/doubleclick passing to parent,
           for example channel editor box causing 'track lock' column icon to light.
      *Arranger Feature - Multiple selected tracks common property editing:
        - You can now edit a property and it will change all the selected tracks.
          Currently works for track channel column and midi output port.
          
18.01.2016:
        - Strips are raised when dragged in mixer (they should also get a solid background)
        - When sorting mixer as arranger moving strips in mixer affects arranger also (rj)
16.01.2016:
        - Added ability to rearrange mixer A and/or sync it to the arranger look
          Features:
            - Traditional look
            - Sync to arranger
            - Manually rearrange mixer with drag and drop
            - Allow individual strips to be hidden (re-enable them from the view menu)
          Still bugs to iron out and allow mixer B to also work (rj)
08.01.2016
        - Fixed icon pos for transport toolbar (rj)
15.01.2016
        - Routing popup menu: Fix stereo grouping mode not connecting both channels
           if second channel is clicked. (Tim)

        - System-wide accuracy fixes, part 1:
          Enforcement of audio controller double-precision floating point accuracy internally, 
           all the way up to the lowest-level structure Port (in plugin.h). Port now has a double value
           besides the existing float value. All track, plugin, and synth code changed to use double-precision 
           wherever possible (only Track can take advantage of double - plugins/synths only use floats).
           
        - Due to inaccuracy in log*() functions, muse_math.h was added where special macros are defined for:
           muse_log10r() and muse_val2dbr() (round to the nearest .000001), and muse_db2val().
          These use log10 and pow10. Some critical code will use the poor-accuracy fast_log*() functions 
           in fastlog.h for speed, while other code takes advatage of (requires) our more accurate macros.
        - Audio strips: Ensured and verified accuracy and round-trip consistency of vol, aux, gain sliders
           and labels, and their controllers.
          Fixed strip slider problems honouring Settings 'Slider minimum value'. 
          This value now means 'off' or 'muted' (-inf dB), not some value below it like before. Test OK.
13.01.2016
      By Tim:
        - More note-off fixes related to 21.12.2015: Added Instrument Definition Files NoteOffMode attribute.
          Enforcement of internal note-off velocity usage, and no internal midi Event zero note-on velocities.
        - Fixed old -l locale switch problem by adding QLocale::setDefault();
12.01.2016
      By Tim:
        - Mixer makeover in progress:
        - Replaced strip knobs with horizontal sliders.

21.11.2015:
        - Auto resample imported wave files to project's sample rate (danvd)
18.11.2015:
	- Added double click on Port column to open the gui of a synth (rj)
31.10.2015
      By Tim E. Real:
      * New routing capabilities:
        - New: Persistent routes: If a device disappears (say USB Midi) we remember it.
          Currently works for Jack audio and midi routes. 
          TODO: Expand concept to include persistent Synth Tracks, Rack Plugins and Tracks.

        - New: Multi-channel Audio Track routing. Any channel to any channel.
          Fully functional (although maybe a sound engine bug - an unconnected 
           channel may have repeating nonsense sound data.)
          Audio tracks still only have up to two channels (or N synth audio channels), 
           but this feature may help later for true multi-channel Audio Tracks.

          Users connect individual Audio or Midi channels with 'Channel Routes', 
           or all at once with 'Omni' Routes (similar to previous behaviour).

        - New: Graphical Routing dialog redone and enhanced. Almost complete.
          Added to routing popups as "Open Advanced Router".
          Middle Connections View window, which can be scrolled. 
                  Thick lines are Omni Routes and thin ones are Channel Routes.
          Each pane's tree has textual Omni nodes, plus some have a 
           'Channel Bar' sub node (an array of connectable Channels).
          All nodes are organized in 'Category' nodes.
          Itemized Master Connection List synchronized with left and right panes.
          Filter buttons: Show only selected nodes in left or right pane
                  Show only routeable nodes in the other (right or left) pane
                  Show all 200 Midi Ports (else it filters unused/unrouted ones)

        - Routing popup menus redone. Test OK, some cosmetic tweaks aside. 
          Shows Channel Routing matrices, plus easy single-click Omni Routes.
          Uniform audio and midi routing popup menus.
          Full keyboard support.
        - Note: Keyboard action activation for ALL popup menus, including routing, 
                 has been changed from space bar to Enter. Hold ctrl to 'stay open'.
                 
        - New: Routing popup menus for Midi Tracks now allow you to do Jack Midi 
           routing from the menus! Like "Connect this Midi Track to Jack Midi port 
           XYZ via Midi Port 123:MyJackMidiDeviceName".
           
        - Midi Track to Audio Input routing (for soloing chaining) greatly simplified.
          Instead of a cumbersome dual system of Midi Track to Midi Port route and 
           Midi Port to Audio Input route PER track channel, now it is simply a more 
           direct Midi Track to Audio Input Omni Route. No 'channels' involved.
          This behaviour is different than before, but should still serve the purpose
           of soloing chaining.

        - Instead of one route for all 16 Midi Track channels using a bit-wise mask for 
           the Route::channel member, it is now reverted back to one route per channel.
          This makes all routing uniform (Route::channel now always means 'a channel'),
           no special code for Midi Track routes.
          (Applies only to Midi Track input routes for now.)

      * File operations:
        - A new system of warning users about loading older song file versions 
           is in place and operational. It uses the MusE File Version number 
           found in the xml module. Increment it wisely given these new warnings, 
           especially if 'auto-converters' are 'quietly' enacted while loading.
        - Added conversion code to transform older loaded files into the format
           which this version currently stands at.
        - Saving and loading tests OK so far but may need a few tweaks.
        
      * Midi config dialog:
        - New: Device List added, with 'Delete' button.
        - New: Command-line flag disables startup 'midi auto-discover/fill devices/ports'.
        - Default Jack Midi Device names have been changed.
          Instead of 'mirroring' the long Jack Midi port names, helpful but NOT good - a 
           different Jack port or multiple ports can be connected making the name meaningless - 
           Midi Devices are now simply named like "Jack Midi 1".
        - Fixed improper Native VST version number display in synth list.

23.10.2015
        - Moving to 3.0.0 release (danvd)
23.09.2015
        - New cpu usage metering algorithm without jack dependency (danvd)

          add more status info! (rj)
30.05.2015:
         - Patch from Michele Ballabio to compile muse without LV2 enabled added (rj)
15.05.2015
         - Added some missing initializations for native VST synths (rj)

03.04.2015:
         - Made raster colors in midi editor editable and section dividers in track list (rj)
15.03.2015:
         - Changed string handling to allow international characters in fluid synth
           as well as wave tracks, this has affected several parts of muse, not the
           least undo/redo. Internally handling of strings have been changed to QString 
           instead of char * in several places. This to minimize conversions as this
           is a big source of errors. String conversions from .toLatin1 have been changed
           to toLocal8Bit and QString::fromLocal8Bit in many places. I think this is 
           right way but it needs more testing. Fixes bug #361 (rj)
02.03.2015:
         - Slow motion moving of editing of automation with shift key (rj)

18.01.2015:
         - Added shortcut to edit track name, F2 (rj)
         - Added multi toggle of mute, solo and midi track type.

17.01.2015:
         - Added link library sndfile for SimpleDrums (rj)
         - typo with duplicate tracks shortcut fixed (rj)

         - Implemented presets saving and updating for LV2 synths/rack plugins (danvd)
         - LV2 presets are stored in common format and can be
           shared between lv2 hosts (danvd)
         - Integrated lv2,lilv,sord,serd,sratom,zix libraries into MusE's source tree.
           Now MusE can be compiled without external LV2 dependences at all (danvd)
         - Reworked Appearance::defaultStyle static QString variable (static var init fiasco fix) (danvd)
15.01.2015:
         - Fixed bug with setting name for dupliated tracks and reworked a bit (rj)

           Added 'bool ClonePart::is_deleted', set/cleared when parts/tracks deleted/added. Checked in Part::readFromXml(). 
16.06.2014:
         - Transformation to non-shared event lists (started by Florian) is virtually complete. (Tim) 
           Events have an ID now, shared among clone parts. 
           New: Fast pending operations lists: They replace RT "execute/revert ops stage-2". 
         - A few more commands support Undo/Redo now, like setting global tempo. 
         - Handful of (un)related fixes along the way.       
29.04.2014:
         - Added more hints to DidYouKnow dialog (rj)
         - Improved README.txt for share/scripts (rj)
         - Improved scripting interface, picks time signature from the start of the

           if operations list not empty.
10.01.2014:
         - Instrument Editor now basically complete: Added Initialization Sequence editor. (Tim)
           Initialization sequence sysex's can be entered manually or chosen from pre-defined list
           using sysex event editor.
         - Sysex event editor now allows selection from pre-defined Instrument Sysex list.
         - Revised and edited Roland SD-50.idf by Patrick (split into GM2/nonGM2).

17.10.2013:
         - Fixed drag&drop plugins sometimes not working when built with optimize (rj)
10.10.2013:
         - Added a visual metronome to Bigtime (rj)
09.10.2013:
         - Changed track dragging to move instead of swap (rj)
         - Removed projects from 'recent' menu if they no longer exist (rj)
08.10.2013:
         - Added line drawing of tempo in graphical master track editor (rj)

         - Changed beat lines to a darker shade (rj)
02.09.2013:
         - Display git hash and date in the about box instead of svn revision (Orcan)

01.09.2013:
         - Mods/fixes to Midi Input Transformator plugin: (Tim)
           Fixed some bugs when reading procVal2Op from song.
           'Program' is now allowed 'Event type' selection.
           'Toggle' is a new Processing Value#2 Operation. It toggles between Value#1 and Value#2.
           This means for example a standard midi foot controller (which only sends program changes)
            can now be used to send TOGGLED midi CC values, say back to an effects unit
            thus the foot controller becomes like regular 'chained' stomp boxes, operating
            upon individual effects.
14.05.2013:
         - When midi in is enabled in drum editor the selected track is moved along with
           the triggered key (rj)

         - Yet another MAJOR audio engine and plugin/synth process chain re-write. (Tim...)
         - Track controllers (vol, pan) now sample-accurate.
         - Track controllers (vol, pan) slope limited for near-noiseless operation. TODO: User settings.
         - Fixed: "Duplicate Selected Tracks" crashes. Also now copies plugins and synths too.
         - DSSI + Native VST: Fixed not remembering generic/native GUI pos/size. TODO: DSSI native GUI.
         - Fixed regression by flo: Sliders were recording multiple automation points at same value.
         - Fixed canvases not remembering position/zoom - everything reopens at exact same pos/zoom now.
         - Fixed automatable audio GUI controls 'jumpy' in TOUCH mode if heavy graphics causing slowdowns.
           When pressed, any control now truly 'disengages' from competing/intefering controller stream.
         - Improved audio automation modes, + READ mode can now be interrupted by GUI or ext control.
         - MESS synths (esp Deicsonze): Controls (like Track Info program) and synth controls now mirror
            each other, both ways.
         - Deicsonze softsynth: Fixed several problems: Not remembering settings + ladspa plugin settings,
            midi controllers were in wrong domain - moved to NRPN14 type. TODO: Fix 'biased' midi controllers
            like pan and detune etc.
         - Native VST: Call idle periodically. Makes some plugins like Glitch work, as per LAD mail.
05.04.2013:
         - Change window title when there are unsaved changes (rj)
         - Add auto-save feature, when enabled tries to save after 5 minutes
           when there has been changes, unless transport is running (rj)
04.04.2013:
         - Added pitch control to SimpleDrums, first version (rj)
         - Fixed Ctrl+arrows in the arranger so the track list is scrolled (rj)
29.03.2013:
         - MusE 2.1.2 released! (rj)
28.03.2013:
         - Allow reading old drummaps for new style drumtracks (rj)
         - Added metronome icon in main window (rj)
27.03.2013:
         - Fixed moving events with keyboard in Drum editor (rj)
10.03.2013:
         - Added color settings for: midi events in arranger,wave events in arranger, wave events in wave editor (rj)
05.03.2013:
         - Added shortcut printout of tools in tool menu (rj)
03.02.2013:
         - Generalized theming somewhat more and added a basic Ardour complementary theme (rj)
28.02.2013:
         - Wave Editor: Fixed some painting problems. Optimizations, speed boosts. (Tim)
24.02.2013:
         - Improved dark theme, midi editors now set background color, the current part of the ruler is darker.
           Theme setting separated from the regular Ok button in the Appearance settings. Also fixed the color 
           viewer in the color selector when using the dark theme. (rj)
23.02.2013:
         - Added missing line draw shortcut (F) to drum editor. (Tim)
22.02.2013:
         * New: Install pre-built PDF + single/split HMTL docs. Separate devel docs. Added build script. (Tim)
           Build script is /doc/build_docs.sh You'll want to use it or a variant to get the HTML .aux files.
           Fixed table in my Appendix in tex file so it works with HTML.
         - For now, I've changed F1 help to open PDF, if not found fallback to HTML.
           I've #define MUSE_USE_PDF_HELP_FILE in help.cpp. Undefine for HTML only.
           May at least need to keep track of viewer process (don't open copies), also try context-sensitive help.
           Help opener always been LANG ready (looks for _xx) but this new build script is not 'automatic'.
         - TODO: For some reason the generated HTML developer docs contain nonsense. (Unknown formatters?)
         - Added new french translation from Yann Collette (rj)
21.02.2013:
         - Fixed: Multiple label warnings in the LaTeX doc. Reference and formatting fixes. (Orcan)
         - Improved: Table of contents and hyperrefs in te LaTeX doc. (Orcan)
19.02.2013
         * MASSIVE FIXES: MANY editor, usability, operation fixes and changes. (Tim...)
         - Please see the files README.usage and README.shortcuts for general changes.
         - Added: Pan and Zoom tools to editors. P + Z shortcuts. Added a Settings item for alternate behaviour.
         - Fixed: MAJOR Canvas class re-writes/simplifications!
         - Fixed: ALL auto-scrolling. Was 'drifting' while scrolling. Accuracy is solid now.
         - Fixed: Moving/new parts now fit into the tracks they are hovering over.
         - Improved: "Velocity per-note" is now per-graph. Also does not cause main window to activate (w/ Robert's new styles).
         - Fixed: Pianoroll and Drum Editor 'Snap' boxes not remembering 1st or 3rd columns.
         - Fixed: Arranger 'Snap' was not stored or remembered.
         - Fixed: Accelerator buttons shift/ctrl/alt for moving/copying/cloning / restricting movement.
         - Fixed: Shift key restricting movement: Ignore snap setting now.
         - Fixed: Resize shift key ignore snap setting now.
         - Fixed: Draw new item shift key ignore snap setting now.
         - Fixed: Shift key was not snapping to vertical.
         - Fixed/changed: Drum velocity level hot-keys/order. LV3 is default now. Re-ordered all MusE drum maps' LV3/LV4.
         - Fixed: Open Wave Editor shortcut changed from Ctrl-W to Ctrl-Y due to ambiguity with MDI 'Close Window'.
         - Fixed: ALL 'Speaker' related playing of notes. Works with new notes, moving notes, piano press etc.
         - Fixed: ALL 'Speaker' related notes now send true note-offs instead of zero-velocity note-ons.
         - Fixed: Drum 'Cursor' mode was playing double notes.
         - Fixed: New Drums 'Cursor' mode and instrument up/down movement was broken, jumping all over the place.
         - Fixed: Drum 'Cursor' mode was not working if no controller graphs were shown. (Silly error.)
         - Improved: Shortcut listings: Added Wave/Score categories. Re-categorized several keys. Updated README.shortcuts
         - Fixed: Memory leaks in CtrlEdit class (ownerships).
         - Fixed: Drum Editor not saving tool state.
         - Improved: Right-click menus expanded. Now also shows 'Tools' menu when clicked on parts.
17.02.2013
         - Added patch from Willy Foobar to remove warnings from compilation (rj)
13.02.2013:
         * Added basic theme support selection, currently two themes selectable, light and dark (rj)
07.02.2013:
         * Feature: choice of new metronome with different sounds and adjustable volume.
           Also has additional ticks before each standard tick. The idea is to improve timing.
           Still needs some work, especially buggy for large time signatures, e.g. 3/16 (rj)
04.02.2013:
         - Fixed gain adjustment with 'Other' choice in wave editor, it was reversed (rj)
02.02.2013:
         * Solved: "Old style" Drums: Track channel/port re-enabled, drum list columns default to them. (Tim...)
           The drum list port and channel columns are now blank by default until overridden by user.
           When blank they default to the track port and channel.
           Internally, -1 is now an acceptable value for members DrumMap::port and ::channel, meaning default to track.
           All built-in drum maps have been changed, as well as the initial and blank DrumMap structures.
         - Since Old Style Drum and New Style Drum had the same icon, and the only way to tell the difference between them
            was the port and channel columns, and that difference is now gone, this required some icon and colour changes.
         - Fixed Old Style Drum lockup: Certain item channel overrides caused infinite loop in Audio::processMidi().
28.01.2013:
         - MusE 2.1.1 released!
         - Added setting for default track height (rj)
27.01.2013:
         * Feature: Shortcuts dialog modeless + has default global shortcut Ctl+Shift+F1 + "Printable file" button. (Tim)
         - Memory leaks! Many widgets and dialogs had no parent and were not deleted!  (Tim)
           Including several top-level editors such as LMaster, MasterEdit, ListEdit, and WaveEditor!
           Created MusE::deleteParentlessDialogs(), call it from MusE::closeEvent() to delete all parentless dialogs:
            appearance, metronomeConfig, shortcutConfig, midiSyncConfig, midiFileConfig, globalSettingsConfig,
            mitPluginTranspose, midiInputTransform, midiFilterConfig, midiRemoteConfig, midiRhythmGenerator, midiTransformerDialog.
           Also moved call of destroy_function_dialogs() into it instead of at end of main. (Consolidation.)
           Verified that all destructors were being called.
25.01.2013:
         * Feature/fix: Zoom at cursor! Zoom Ctl+PgUp/PgDown (defaults) and Ctl+MouseWheel now zoom about cursor. (Tim)
           Eliminated redundant call in ScrollScale::setMag(), by blocking signals.
           Consolidated all HorizontalZoomIn and HorizontalZoomOut functions into a single HorizontalZoom.
           Added eight more 'quick zoom' levels to class ScrollScale.
           Modified all HorizontalZoom functions to pass cursor offset, and use it in ScrollScale::setScale().
19.01.2013:
         - Fixed confused controllers on seek with multiple muted/off midi tracks/parts on same port/channel. (Tim)
           In MidiDevice::handleSeek(): Re-wrote controller value sending section - fixed obeying mute/off section.
17.01.2013:
         - Fixed song length way too big after recorded wave is added. (Tim)
           Was a simple regression in Song::cmdAddRecordedWave back when tempo recording was added.
15.01.2013:
         - Reinstate old Arranger "Paste to track" (Ctl+Shift+V) and "Paste clone to track" (Ctl+Shift+B). (Tim...)
         - Changed default shortcut of Arranger "Paste clone" to Ctl+B.
         - Changed default shortcut of Arranger "Paste (show dialog)" to Ctl+G.
         - Removed Arranger "Paste clone with dialog". Instead, paste dialog now remembers 'clone' checkbox setting.
         - Fixed Pianoroll/Drum Ctl+V paste bug was pasting into other parts: Always paste into current part.
           TODO: Score Editor still not working because there never seems to be a current part! Must ask Florian...
         - Fixed Pr/Dr Function dialogs bring main window to front: Don't give them a parent, add destroy_function_dialogs().
         - Fixed "Duplicate Track" feature: If selected 'copy parts', it was quietly cloning. Re-wrote ASSIGN_PARTS sections.
           Now it copies both clone and non-clone parts. Tests OK but needs a good workout. (Maybe push Parts to Undo list?)
           TODO: Found C.O.W. bug when de-cloning a part on a duplicated Wave Track - it's still a clone. Investigating...
         - Fixed Old-style Drum Editor: Was not playing new notes as they were drawn. Re-wrote a DrumCanvas::newItem(),
            and eliminated dynamic_casts.
         - Don't play midi parts if track is off.   
13.01.2013:
         - remote should depend on widgets through #including app.h otherwise Python bindings don't compile (Orcan)
06.01.2013:
         - MusE 2.1 released!
03.01.2013:
         - Fixed SimpleDrums GUI issues on AVLinux (and supposedly other debian based distros) (rj)
01.01.2013: Happy new year!
         - Fixed playback of drumsounds during editing for new type drum editor (rj)
29.12.2012:
         - Added clear automation to automation menu
         - Changed automation color selection to hopefully make more sense with styles that
           don't explicitly show an unchecked visual, color is shown in first menu also and
           automation is enabled when color is selected in the color menu (rj)
18.12.2012
         - Enable fluidsynth and simpledrums to search for missing sounds in project dir if
           the path was missing. (rj)
         - Added change-dir to project dir when saving or loading songs, it needs to be
           researched a bit if this has any drawbacks. The idea is that if plugins or
           whatever wants to write to disk it should happen in the project dir. (rj)
14.12.2012:
         - Made simpledrums ask to load another sample if a sample wasn't found during loading (rj)
         - when dragging multiple notes in editors they are not played, to avoid hanging notes (rj)
12.12.2012:
         - Fixed some vst controls stuck. (Tim)
         - Added vst master timebase (sequencers should work now). WIP Not quite finished. (Tim)
         - Fixed weird QString bug causing some patch names to appear with garbage characters. (Tim)
11.12.2012:
         - Fix native vst path (VST_NATIVE_PATH, VST_PATH, then preset). Also ladspa, dssi paths. Added -help text. (Tim)
10.12.2012:
         - Changed versions to rc2
         - Changed name of SimpleSynth to original name SimpleDrums, this
           does affect loading of songs using SimpleSynth. Open the song file
           in a text editor and change the name of all SimpleSynth to SimpleDrums
           and all should be ok. (rj)
09.12.2012:
         - Fix VST names: Use filename if effect name or product name blank. (Tim)
         - Fix bug 3594221: End-to-end midi notes don't retrigger. My bad. (Tim)
           In MEvent::sortingWeight(): Note-ons with zero velocity are really note-offs.
08.12.2012:
         - Native VST fixes and changes. (Tim)
           Redid cmake options. Please do 'prune' and carefully reconfigure.
           Fixed track info banks and patch popup list bank issues.
           Fixed plugins such as NoizeMaker: Kill harmful redundancies - call getParameter before setParameter.
           Fixed crash reloading song with huge-chunk plugin like NoizeMaker: Stack overflow in processEvent().
              TODO: Fix all other such sysex stack buffer usages like possibly in DSSI.
07.12.2012:
         * Feature: Native VST instruments support. Best results are from compiling with the vst sdk. (Tim)
           Featuring: True sample-accurate parameter automation, full native GUI support for TOUCH, WRITE modes.
           New cmake options for enabling native vst, enabling true sdk support, and the vst header path.
           Plugins environment variable is currently VST_NATIVE_PATH else "/usr/lib/vst:/usr/local/lib/vst".
           TODOs: Parameter ranges: fixed at linear 0.0 - 1.0 for now. Program categories.
                  Dynamic port changes. Plugins correct path and env var? No rack effect plugins yet. 
25.11.2012:
         - Changed playback of midi in editors to default to on (rj)
21.11.2012:
         * Fixed: Markers and synth windows don't open at all on some desktops like Lubuntu. (Tim)
           Solution was combination of REMOVAL of fix for "bug: 2811156 Softsynth GUI unclosable..."
            (of which said removal BY ITSELF DID NOT FIX this problem) AND removal of some superfluous show()s.
           Tested OK with Lubuntu and XFCE (which the original fix was for). 
           Thanx to knowledgable tester who told us to remove that bugfix.
20.11.2012:
         - Fixed audio stuttering loud annoying repeated segments upon seek. (Tim)
           Slight readjustment of audio prefetch and midi thread priority (-5 and -1 instead of +1 and +2).
17.11.2012:
         * Improved: Deicsonze soft synthesizer: Fixed crash, bugs, added ladspa plugins. (Tim)
           TODO: No plugin control automation. Some oddities with log slider/entry ranges. Maybe add delay wet/dry.
         * Added: Request from forums: Auto-start Jack upon MusE startup. Command-line disable switch -J added. (Tim)
         * "widgets" depend on "instruments". (Orcan)
15.11.2012:
         * Improved: Popup menus: Auto-breakup too-wide menus in class PopupMenu. (Tim)
           In some cases X/Qt was giving up if too wide AND/OR too many columns, menu would not appear.
           Tested OK with Deicsonze track info patch popup, and a synth plugin with > 2000 automation controls.
13.11.2012:
         - Fix init of gain for duplicated audiotracks (rj)
12.11.2012:
         - Added aftertouch controllers to all relevant remaining instrument files. (Tim)
         - Synths: Added aftertouch controller to fluidsynth, and aftertouch/poly-aftertouch to DSSI. (Tim)
11.11.2012:
         - Finished Aftertouch controllers: Removed PAfter and CAfter Event types. Quietly convert such
            events in old songs into the new controllers. Converted midi input (hopefully). (Tim)
           Updated README.instruments. 
         * Feature: Piano KB and drum list show coloured dots when per-pitch controllers exist or have data. (Tim)
03.11.2012:
         * Improved: Instrument Editor (controller tab): Redesigned. Fixed MANY bugs. Should be SOLID now. (Tim)
           Two new columns: "Show in midi tracks" and "Show in drum tracks".
         * Improved: Midi controller graph 'Ctrl' popup menus now unified (cascading). (Tim)
           'Edit Instrument' menu item now takes you right to the instrument and controllers tab.
         * Feature request: Aftertouch and PolyAftertouch (channel/key pressure) are true MusE controllers now. (Tim)
           Now FULLY supported in controller graphs AND in the improved Instrument Editor / Definition Files.
         - Midi controller stuff: Fixed some bugs, added some methods and improvements.
28.10.2012:
         * Improved: Eliminated copious unrequired "controller" sections from songs and templates. (Tim)
           These controllers such as volume, pan are already always added, so it's useless to store them when "Off".
           Added midiport.cpp:defaultManagedMidiController, populated and used in init, also used when saving song
            to look up these controllers and ignore them if "Off".
         - Eliminated ALL "controller" sections from built-in templates, which were already over-populated. 
         - Also eliminated ALL "midiport" sections from buit-in templates, so that they don't touch existing setups. 
         - Also, specifically for the "synth.med", changed synth ports to 198 and 199 so that it is (almost) 
            guaranteed not to touch existing used ports with the synths. 
         * Improved: Also, wrote mechanism allowing track port/channel = -1 in templates, so that it uses your 
            chosen default output port/channel from the midi ports setup dialog. Try midiGM.med template for example.
27.10.2012:
         * Improved: Velocity graphs. Icon for showing per-note or all velocities. Also found in Settings. (Tim)
         * Improved: Piano KB has current selected note (yellow). For velocity/polyaftertouch/other per-note ctrls.  (Tim)
         - Bad timing warning now has "don't show again". (Tim)
         - Added 'speaker' icon to drum edit. And drum list and piano keyboard now obey the 'speaker' icon. (Tim)
22.10.2012:
         - Oops, fixed regression: Re-add default managed controllers to midi ports at Song::clear. (Tim)
         - W.I.P. Preparations for Aftertouch and Poly Aftertouch (channel and key pressure) graph editing. (Tim)
21.10.2012:
         - Slight changes to midi track info hbank/lbank/program dblclick on/off behaviour. (Tim)
           TODO Need to improve by having separate 'last valid hbank/lbank/program' instead of single 'last valid value'.
20.10.2012:
         - In MidiEventBase::read() Repair controllers saved with lo byte 0xff. (Tim)
           No such control. It was supposed to be 0x00. It's an error caused by a previous bug, fixed now.
19.10.2012:
         * Improved: Midi initializations. New settings options, can be 'quiet'. Complete rewrite of initializations coding. (Tim) 
         * Improved: Midi controller graphs: Control selector 'S' popup now stay-open, AND NOW with multi-coloured dots: 
                      Blank: Controller has no current 'manual' value (it is 'Off'), and no stored automation values.
                      Blue:  Controller has a current 'manual' value (it is not 'Off'), but no stored automation values.
                      Green: Controller has no current 'manual' value, but does have stored automation values.
                      Gold:  Controller has a current 'manual' value AND has stored automation values.
                     Bonus! Pianoroll and drum edit 'Ctrl' buttons ALSO now popup this very same menu. No more clumsy
                             adding of controllers - now just hold the ctrl key and select away and... "bing bing bing 1 2 3". (Tim)
         * Improved: 'Old' drum track 'drum controllers' display and operation: Fixed several problems: Incorrect mapping to drum map etc. (Tim)
                     Now if more than one drum is pointing to the same 'anote', the others are overlaid as grey slivers. (TODO Not quite done.)
                     TODO: Although THESE "drum controllers" are improved, there are conceptual problems with NON-drum controllers old drum map:
                           If a NON-drum controller such as pan is adjusted, what then? If the drum map contains more than one port/channel/anote 
                            it should be sent to ALL of them BUT we would like a 'track override' which when turned off, 'pan' could be locally
                            adjusted for EACH drum having different ports/channels/anotes. (So in theory drum track channel should be reinstated.) 
09.10.2012:
         - Fixed old fluidsynth bug: Drum patch numbers incorrect. (Tim)
           Confusion due to special fluidsynth drum bank = 129. Changed FluidSynth::getFirstPatch, 
            ::getNextPatch, and CTRL_PROGRAM section of ::setController. 
         - Midi track info patches popup menu: Don't display category if empty. (Tim)
08.10.2012:
         * !!! Song type is now removed !!! : (Tim)
           TODO: Instrument init sequences. Need some kind of editor. Need timing mechanism while in 'stop' mode. 
                 Was thinking these events should be in FRAMES or real time - not affected by tempo. Jack slow sync 
                  callback might help. (Also try to re-enable metronome precount - similar concept here!)
         * Improved: Multi-port (aka multi-channel) midi import and export, via Device Name, Port, or Instrument metas. (Tim)
           - MusE can now export a midi file and re-import exactly as it was, all ports + devices + instruments incl.
           - Extra options for import/export added.
           - Import midi now passes 'unabsorbed' meta events on to the track. They were discarded before - lost forever.
           - Solved: Export midi now stores an instrument's Init sequence, instead of the old song type sysexes.
           - MPEventList now has highly customized same-time sorting, helps 'cement' import/export events in place, such 
              as controllers or program changes before notes, instrument metas before mode sysexes. (EventList NOT done.)
         - Old bug: Fixed superfluous NULLS in meta texts in midi export.
         - Old bug, annoying: Midi Import: parts are too short and 'events past end' indicator is on.
         - TODO: Bug: Deicsonze: Midi track info patch popup: Screen all black until esc or click.
04.10.2012:
         - Added Gain knob on channel strip for audio tracks (rj)
         - Added descriptive tooltips for midi parameters in midi track info (rj)
03.10.2012:
         - Changed WaveTrack and AudioInput to create mono tracks, AudioInputs
           are also no longer muted upon creation (rj)
02.10.2012:
         - Added descriptive tooltip to cursor mode in drum editor (rj)
01.10.2012:
         - Fixed Step shortcuts 0,9 in drum editor so they actually update 
           the step size and fixed update of controller view when stepping 
           up and down (rj)
30.09.2012:
         - Added part creation from wave editor - to make this really usable
           more functions to set tempo etc, are needed (rj)
         - Fixed name length of Aux ports and added index (rj)
         - Fixed issue with moving aux:es in the track list causing the auxes
           to be mixed up (rj)
29.09.2012:
         - Added handling of missing soundfonts in fluidsynth load so
           a dialog asking for replacement soundfont pops up (rj)
17.09.2012:
         * Introducing: Copy On Write for waves. (Tim)
           It asks to copy, to the Project Directory, any wave to be modified which is either 
            not writable or is shared with another independent (non-clone) wave event.
           TODO: Improve by asking even for writable waves outside the Project Directory 
            (add a 'copy' checkbox column to the dialog, settable only under certain conditions). 
         * Added: Informative text on Undo/Redo buttons/menu text/tooltips ("Undo AddTrack" etc). (Tim)
           In cases of multiple items in one operation, the first is shown, with ", .." ("Undo AddTrack, ..").
16.09.2012:
	 - Fixed allocation error with drag&drop of plugins (rj)
	 - Fixed close menu alternative in Instrument editor (rj)
	 - Changed Aux name on strips to reflect the actual Aux strip name (rj)
         - Fixed CR:3567893 Play Event on note creation (rj)
         - Removed 'fluid' from the list of built synths, it is inferior to fluidsynth
           and causes confusion (rj)
09.09.2012:
         - Added instructions on how to record audio with MusE to the new manual (rj)
08.09.2012:
         - Follow up to Improved Wave Editor: Added Edit -> Adjust Wave Offset. Helps compensate for latency. (Tim) 
           FIXME: Respect clones! If operating on two selected clones of the same part, an extra event is created.
           May not be this code's problem but seems like it, other operations like moving an event seem OK.
07.09.2012:
         - Bug 3555569, 3555572: New informative ERROR, WARNING and HINT messages in cmake build script. (Tim)
           Also, detect and report missing Doxygen executable.
06.09.2012:
         - Bug 3555581: No synths listed in Edit menu: main.cpp: Move initMidiSynth() ahead of MusE. (Tim)
         - Unrelated simple change: Privatize Arranger::parentWin. (Tim)
         - Feature request 3565102: FLAC audio file import. (Tim)
04.09.2012: 
         - Fix for forum topic "Ordering of simultaneous events". (Tim)
           Methods EventList::add() and ::move() now sort all same-time notes AFTER controllers.
03.09.2012: summer sleep is over! plugins can now be grouped (flo)
14.08.2012:
         * Introducing: Improved Wave Editor. (Tim)
           Class WaveView is replaced by WaveCanvas. 
           Wave Events can be selected, added, moved and deleted.
           TODO: Bunch o' stuff, but currently it should be as good or better than the old editor.
04.08.2012:
         * Introducing: More bits for Song Changed SC_* flags. (Tim)
           Added MusECore::SongChangedFlags_t (in new type_defs.h file). Declared as int64 type.
           All Song Changed parameters, handlers, connections, calls, colateral operations etc. now use 
            this new SongChangedFlags_t. 
           All the handlers are now ready for the code bodies to accept any extra flags, devs need not
            do anything more than define new SC_* flags and write support inside the handlers.
           Please beware these possible extra flags when writing songChanged handlers and setting updateFlags. 
04.08.2012:
         - Optimizations: Added Master::songChanged and ArrangerView::songChanged to filter some SCs. (Tim)
01.08.2012:
         - Finished the Sysex Editor in the Instrument Editor. (Tim)
           Create, delete, save named instrument sysexes. Does nothing more than that for now.
29.07.2012:
         - Tweaked drum editor zooming to give correct initial zoom (rj)
12.07.2012:
         - Fixed controllers go wacky after moving effects rack plugins up/down. My bad! (Tim)
           Rewrote CtrlList::operator= and several others. Tested OK.
         - Also fixed existing problem: After moving rack plugins up/down, graphs disappear. (Tim)
           Simple oversight in AudioTrack::swapControllerIDX: New members 'color', 'visible', 
            and 'don't show' weren't being copied.
         - Documentation: Some contributions to the documentation.tex file. (Tim)
08.07.2012:
         - Changed naming convention for recorded wave files to include track name and it's
           take number. (rj)
         - added a warning dialog for the delete track key shortcut. (rj)
         - Use cmake's own FindPythonLibs module instead of pkgconfig to detect Python (Orcan)
06.07.2012:
         - Updated Czech translation from Pavel Fric (rj)
         - Some strings that were not translatable are now (as reported by Pavel Fric) (rj)
         - Updated translation files, and started completing swedish translation a bit (rj)
         - increased zoom range in arranger, reversed zoom in wave editor (rj)
04.07.2012:
         - added inc/dec tick for events in the list editor (rj)
03.07.2012:
         - Fixed new drum parts disappear as sson as they're drawn. (Tim)
30.06.2012:
         =======================================
         * 2.0 tagged (rj)
         =======================================
         - Emergency crash fix: In automation popup midi control 'Clear' item. (Tim)
           Cannot delete any actions from menu due to recent December PopupMenu fixes. 
29.06.2012:
         - Fixed file dialog: disable 'read configuration' for midi files. (Tim)
         - Updated swedish translation (rj)
         - reworked the REC button somewhat (rj)
28.06.2012:
         - External sync fixes: Now have user-selectable of clock filtering and quantization. (Tim)
         - Fixed clicking tempo master does not update wave parts. Allow SC_MASTER to call canvas->partsChanged. (Tim)
         - Fixed problems with recorded wave part and event sizes, and 'past end' indicator. (Tim)
         - Don't resize or destroy wave events upon part resize. (Tim)
         - Init support for controlling midi engine from Jack timebase master. Completely disabled for now. (Tim)
26.06.2012:
         - Added updated Czech translation from Pavel Fric[pavelfric@seznam.cz] (rj)
23.06.2012:
         - automation graphs: deletion with middle-click, fixed automation    (flo93)
                              editing.
18.06.2012:
         - Removed printouts about no longer supported VST implementation,
           use DSSI implementation instead (rj)
         - Some preparations for 2.0 (rj)
16.06.2012:
         - MusE as Jack Timebase master: Corrected ticks_per_beat and bar_start_tick fields. (Tim) 
         - Fixed bug by Geoff B and Flo: Changing a midi port device: We are only interested in altering 
            tracks using the port being changed in the midi port list. And don't change channel. (Tim)
15.06.2012:
        * Sync fix: MusE now records tempo changes from externally clocked midi. (Tim)
          Still experimental but non-intrusive: You will be asked at the end of recording if you  
           want to transfer the recorded tempos to the master tempo graph. 
          Tested OK so far with ALSA and Jack midi. Best results ATM may be when recording from 
           position 0, not 'continuing' a recording or skipping 'fwd' or 'rew'. 
          TODO: Record Jack timebase changes! Find patch someone sent years ago, likely still useful...
11.06.2012:
        - Finally! Audio controller playback has smooooth frame resolution even with large audio buffers. (Tim)
          CtrlList::value() now accepts a nextFrame*, filled with next event frame, which the
           plugin and dssi process use to determine the run sizes. 
          Bonus! This processing is now guaranteed to be ALIGNED with user's chosen minimum control processing 
           period in Settings. Before, it was occasionally going to 1, 2, 4 frame runs etc., was not good. 
          TODO: Sorry, track audio/pan have no 'variable run length' support yet. Choppy with large buffers.
                Tip: If a ping-pong effect is desired, try a plugin for now!
        - Increased default minimum controller period from 64 to 256. Tests showed 256 is just fine, smooth.
10.06.2012:
        - Add midi-to-audio control popups to right-click automation menus. (Tim)
        - Track list audio automation popup now can stay open, for colour and 'clear' items. (Tim)
08.06.2012:
        * Merge: From branch r2_0_extra. (Tim)
        - More automation fixes. In AudioTrack::processAutomationEvents, optimize integer, bool, 
           discrete controller types to avoid multiple dots on flat straight-line graph segments. (Tim)
        - Replaced Song::controllerChange() with a lower-level 
           CtrlList::guiUpdatePending()/clearGuiUpdatePending(). Checked and cleared in 
           Song::beat() at the nice slow heartbeat rate instead of direct calls to QWidget::update().
          This means ALL controls should update their graphs now, and at a more reasonable rate.  (Tim)
        - ARVT_STOP automation events are also recorded now
        - When clicking sliders in the plugin's native GUIs or the
          mixer with SHIFT held down, straight lines are drawn (no
          intermediate control points are recorded)
          TODO: does not yet work for muse-native, but customized GUIs (flo)
07.06.2012:
        - More automation fixes. (Tim)
06.06.2012:
        - Another midi-to-audio mapper classes rewrite. (Tim)
05.06.2012:
        - Rewrote midi-to-audio control mapper classes. (Tim...)
        - Added save and load midi-to-audio settings.
        - Remap or remove mappers when rack items moved or removed.
04.06.2012:
        - Side branch r2_0_extra, copied from release_2_0:
        * Feature: Midi control of audio parameters. (Tim)
        - More important timing, accuracy fixes.
03.06.2012:
        - Merged documentation from local source to repository LaTeX document, 80% done (rj)
27.05.2012:
        * Timing, resolution, accuracy, and automation fixes:  (Tim)
        - Ask audio driver for 'its' current system time instead of wallclock in utils.cpp:curTime(). 
          Reason: Jack's clock source can be wallclock, cycle counter, HPET etc. 
          TODO: Try more Jack time functions for accuracy in Audio::framesSinceCycleStart etc.
        - Fixed automation 'manual' slider values: Update them from automation values at the current time 
           when switching to automation OFF. After some recent changes by me, the 'manual' values were
           left 'independent' of the automation values. While this had interesting effects, the value
           would 'jump' back to the manual value when switching to OFF, which became disconcerting.
          The best solution, in muse_evolution (from where I adopted the previous changes), was to 
           continuously update the manual values during process, but there may be too many controllers,
           so this was the other lesser option. 
        - All audio/plugin GENERIC gui controls now record their automation at FRAME resolution.
          Previously the timestamps were ticks converted to frames (lossy). Now they are true frames.
          This means these recorded graphs can be much denser with vertices now, if needed.
        - Querying of plugin controller values in DssiSynthIF::getData, PluginI::apply, and volume/pan 
           controllers in AudioTrack::copyData/addData is now done at a more proper and accurate 
           frame time instead of wallclock-based queries via AudioTrack::volume/pan/pluginCtrlVal.
          (Sorry, this does not mean frame accuracy on playback yet.)
        - Menu 'Take automation snapshot' now operates with frame resolution. Added a warning message as well.
        - Menu 'Clear automation' enabled and implemented. Added a warning message as well.
        - DSSI synths: Fixed errors with Pitch controller on playback. Removed AND'ing of 0x3FFF in
           CTRL_PITCH section of DssiSynthIF::processEvent.
20.05.2012:
        - MusE can now compile with clang/llvm via -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ flag to cmake. (Orcan)
        - Update some URLs in README. (Orcan)
18.05.2012:
        - Added Czech translation by Pavel Fric[pavelfric@seznam.cz] (rj)
        - fixed native GUIs not updating                            (flo93)
                - removed _guiUpdate{Program,Control[]}
                - OscIF now stores the native GUI's state
                - OscIF doesn't send control changes if they don't differ from the
                    native GUI's state (until enforced)
08.05.2012:
        - ladspa/dssi/simplesynth controls: Fixed logarithmic defaults. (Tim)
           Use log not log10 in plugin.cpp:ladspaDefaultValue(). 
        - ladspa/dssi/simplesynth controls: A better default than 1.0 if none found, compute from upper/lower. (Tim)
           In plugin.cpp:ladspaDefaultValue(). TODO: simplesynth controls still wrong. 
        - ladspa: TAP Reverberator built-in MusE GUI: Fixed wet/dry infinity display "---". (Tim)
           Added DoubleLabel 'offValue' Qt property. Set in file 2142.ui 
07.05.2012:
        - DSSI: Fixed second of two crashes when operating controls while playing notes. (Tim)
          Just ignore rare out-of-order events.
06.05.2012:
        - Added automation right-click remove point and printout with current value, also started 
          working towards editing multiple points (rj)
        - Fixed crash bug in pianoroll when using arrow keys on an empty part (rj)
        - DSSI: Fixed one of two crashes when operating controls while playing notes. WIP on other (rarer) crash. (Tim)
05.05.2012:
        * Updated .ts translation files in repository. Updated with -no-obsolete to
          trim away lots of unused strings (rj)
04.05.2012:
        *Added: -A switch: "Force inclusion of ALSA midi even if using Jack". (Tim...) 
        - Fixed intermittent Jack crash at startup with jack <= 1.9.8. Fixed in Jack 1.9.9  
        - Rearranged main.cpp, moved a few init items into it from app.cpp 
        - Fixed "Jack calling while audio disconnected" errors at startup.
        - Fixed LASH leak: Added lash_args_destroy().
        - Fixed icons leak: Destroy all icons.
        - Fixed function dialogs leak: Created with NULL parent.
        - Removed QApplication::setColorSpec() call. Caused "pixmap is not an X11 class pixmap" errors.
        - Fixed style changing problems (transparent MDI windows, other artifacts). Requires restart!
03.05.2012:
        - Fixed crash bug with coloring of iR button on aux strip (it does not have one) (rj)
24.04.2012:
        - Changed automation drawing in arranger to be more forgiving
          shift no longer needed and it's not needed to be too close
          to the line. TODO: some cleanup (rj)
23.04.2012:
        - Global Settings: Start song: Changed to allow other templates. (Tim)
          * Please revisit this setting or start with clean config so MusE can 
           initialize the box with the global default.med file.
22.04.2012:
        - Duplicate Tracks: Fixed routing bug. (Tim)
          In tracks' ::internal_assign(), don't call msgAddRoute, push_back the route node,
           because caller later calls msgAddTrack which 'mirrors' that single routing node.
          Exception: Audio Input and Output still need to call msgAddRoute which connects to Jack.
          May still cause audio processing problems ?
        - Added colorhints to iR and oR routing buttons (rj)
21.04.2012:
        - Templates: File dialog: Added 'read Midi Port Configuration' box. (Tim)
        - File dialog: Unset 'read Midi Port Configuration' box for Global folder, set for others. (Tim) 
        - File dialog: Made side bar buttons auto-exclusive. Some fixes, cleanups. (Tim)
19.04.2012:
        - Reverted yesterdays description change, now shows label again (rj)
        - Added tooltips to trackInfo which shows additional info for synths (rj)
        - Fixed focus for tempo and signature widgets and patch selector in midi track info (rj)
        - Fixed RJ's focus fixes. Now tempo/sig toolbar has proper Smart Focus and works in all related windows. (Tim)
        - Removed Smart Focus restart requirement in Settings. Rewrote some silly signal connects. (Tim)
18.04.2012:
        - Prefer native GUI for plugins when double clicking in the rack (rj)
        - Prefer description instead of label in synth name in track list, it's more descriptive (rj)
        - Grayed out "copy plugins" in duplicate track dialog since it's not finished (rj)
17.04.2012:
        - Added gcc4.7 patch from Matthias Klose <doko@debian.org> (rj)
        - Added -Werror=format-security from Alessio Treglia <alessio@debian.org> (rj)
16.04.2012:
        - Fixed some bugs in swedish translation (rj)
14.04.2012:
        - Optimize some QByteArray usages and use length() instead of taking strlen(). (Tim)
12.04.2012:
        - Add new 'type' column to LADSPA browser, add tooltips to AO, AI CO, CI, IP, ID columns. (Tim)
09.04.2012:
        - Feature request: Allow loading of DSSI synths (those with a run*_synth* function) in LADSPA browser. (Tim)
07.04.2012:
        - Fixed bug with drawing of song position toolbar (rj)
25.03.2012:
        - Added "beautifying" frame to the song position toolbar, hope that looks nicer
          for all :) (rj)
24.03.2012:
        - Fixed memory leaks in the undo system. Removed unused ModifyTrack action (flo93)
        - Swapped usage of oPart and nPart in the undo system. this was completely
          braindead: oPart was assigned the nPart_-ctor-parameter and vice versa (flo93)
        - Removed unused UndoOp-ctors (flo93)
        - Code cleanups in undo.cpp (flo93)
        - changed some sharing-menu-debug-messages from debugMsg to heavyDebugMsg (flo93)
        - added a copy-ctor to Part which increases the eventlist's refcounter (flo93)
        - NPart stores serial number (flo93)
        - Changed locale loading to use system setting instead of keyboard setting (rj)
23.03.2012:
        - Changed file loading to use .toLocal8Bit instead of .toAscii seems to 
          fix issues to load files with local chars like åäö in the name (rj)
        - Fixed invalid reads/writes/deletes when having the cliplist editor open:
          there was a funny mixture of reference-counting smartpointers and normal,
          "dumb" pointers, and some pieces of the code relies on the smartpointers
          to delete stuff automatically (which was correct), other pieces just deleted
          stuff, regardless of the refcount.
          now everything using SndFile uses refcounting. HOWEVER this created a MEMORY
          LEAK: when recording to a wave track (this creates a SndFile, refcount=1),
          then undoing this (this doesn't delete, but only stashes away the part and
          so the smart pointer), then opening a new song (this doesn't delete the stashed
          away part and so the smart pointer, so refcount never drops to zero) the SndFile
          is never deleted.                                                         (flo93)
        - Made the DidYouKnow dialog actually work, add lines to share/didyouknow.txt (rj)
20.03.2012:
        - arranger's part canvas now doesn't display thin slivers for
          parts of hidden tracks (flo93)
        - Header::write/readStatus now uses the save/restoreState functions,
          simplifying the code and storing column widths as well (flo93)
        - removed unused and non-working updateTListHeader function (flo93)
        - PixmapButton (red LEDs, and Delta Mode): Eat up context menu events. (Tim)
        - Class SpinBox, DoubleSpinBox, Dentry: Change to consistent "ctrl-double-click on/off". (Tim)
19.03.2012:
        - column state is now stored into the global config, not
          into the song file (flo93)
        - Song load: Arranger MDI window: Fixed size restoration. (Tim)
          In TopWin::readStatus(), if mdisubwin is maximized, restore it before setting pos and height.
        - Changed reporting of bad timing a bit to possibly make it clearer what the problem is 
          and what to do about it (rj)
18.03.2012:
        - Delta/absolute mode button: Improved behaviour. (Tim)
        - Transport and NoteInfo toolbar positional editors: Fixed not updating when tempo or sig changed. (Tim)
          In PosEdit::setValue(), checking different value is not enough. Must check whether resultant msf or mbt values changed.
          TODO: updateValue() is now public so it can be called externally but it is not used yet - make NoteInfo and Transport 
           use it instead of setValue().  
17.03.2012:
        - Custom columns can now either affect tick0 or song->cpos() (flo)
        - hopefully fixed a bug in the custom columns dialog (flo)
16.03.2012:
        - Custom columns now send their controller changes to the device
          automatically if appropriate (flo)
        - Drum editor:  Added missing multiple-note editing. (Tim...)
        - Midi editors: Don't allow notes to be added before part. (Caused crash in Drum editor, odd behaviour in Pianoroll.)
        - Midi editors: Added "Delta Mode" button to Note Info toolbar. 
        - Code cleanups in Pianoroll, Drum editor.
15.03.2012:
        - Updated swedish translation with help from Cristian Ramos (rj)
10.03.2012:
        - Track routing: Fixed duplicate routes: Reverted usage of operation group in Song::addTrack. (Tim)
        - Templates: Default routing: Restored default Jack out/in routes in audio.med, synti.med, default.med, monorecord.med. (Tim)
        - Switch from LIB_PATH_SUFFIX to LIB_SUFFIX, and from CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR to LIB_INSTALL_DIR in CMakeLists.txt. Still fall
          back to CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR if it is specified explicitly instead of LIB_INSTALL_DIR. (Orcan)
        - Fix cmake warning in simpledrums when CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is not set. (Orcan)
09.03.2012:
        - Track list: Popup editors: Pre-select text. (Tim)
        - Track list channel popup editor: Eat up dbl-clcks if already open. Caused pseudo 'wrapping' if disabled arrows dbl-clicked. (Tim)
08.03.2012:
        * Comprehensive focus fixes: (Tim...)
        * New: Gui behaviour option: "Smart Focus": All toolbar boxes give focus back to respective canvases. 
          (Most boxes except Score Velo On/Off changed to StrongFocus, for non-focused wheel support.) 
        - Focusing + tabbing fixes: Exclusions, tightening of tab sequences.
        - !! Most spinboxes now wait until return pressed !!  For example the Song Length box. 
        - PianoRoll toolbar: Fixed auto-repeats - optimized NoteInfo::setDeltaMode(). 
        - Midi boxes: Fixed Ctrl-click on/off.
        - Master Editor: Fixed can't edit if not enabled. Also Transport sig box.
        - TracK Info panel: Fixed Scrolling. TODO: Make step sizes reasonable, same as Pianoroll ScrollBox. 
                                             TODO: Scroll when tabbing among the Track Info controls !
        - Track List key handling: Fixed TList::moveSelection().
        - Visible Tracks: Drums and Synths: Fixed Track::isVisible().
        - Track List, and Master Editor: Fixed popup editors. Sizing fixes. Use no frames. 
        - Event List Editor: Fixed not updating when parts modified.
        - Pianoroll and Drum Editor: Fixed not updating sometimes ex. moving part past end of song.
          (Was returning prematurely from songChanged() coding if they got SC_SOLO.) 
23.02.2012:
        - Compile fix in pyapi.cpp (Orcan)
        - Don't optimize debug builds of simpledrums (Orcan)
14.02.2012:
        - added customizable columns to the arranger (flo93)
13.02.2012:
        - CMake build system: Added cached variable LIB_PATH_SUFFIX, may be set to 64 so that installed library path is lib64 or whatever. (Tim)
12.02.2012:
        - Midi: Force events in play event list to be sent when playing, even if redundant. TODO: Fix sending controllers during seek. (By Tim...)
        - Midi revert: MidiPort::setMidiDevice(): Send controllers in song to synths. Synths were not restoring vol for ex. My old bad.
        - Fluid: Fixed pitch input: Add 8192.
        - Fluid + Fluidsynth + SimpleDrums: ::processEvent(): Don't return true for controllers (why?). Was causing multiple send attempts.
        - SimpleDrums: Fixed too-short plugin chooser: In ctor SS_PluginGui rem'd a couple of height-fixing lines. Hm, FIXME - was OK before.
        - Midi ports config window: Allow default output channel column to unselect all channels ie. no default output channels at all.
31.01.2012:
        - Jack Midi: Added missing midi sync output functions start/stop/SPP etc.  (By Tim...) 
           TODO: Give its own clock, currently it's driven by ALSA clock.  TODO: ALSA clock out seems badly broken.
        - Jack Midi: Fixed Song Position Pointer sync input larger than 10 bars.  
        - ALSA: Seek sends wrong CCs. putMidiEvent() not respecting CTRL_PROGRAM and CTRL_PITCH. (Thanks to Dennis Schulmeister).
        - Routing popup: Fixed crash with empty ports.
        - Jack Midi: Fixed crashes/lockups when 'Use Jack Transport' off. Completely re-wrote Jack dummy tranport sync to behave like Jack.
        - Midi:Increased MIDI_FIFO_SIZE to 4096 and MIDI_REC_FIFO_SIZE to 256.
        - Midi: Sustain: Fixed inhibit/re-enable on stop/play. Also added during seek to quiet things down.
        - Midi: Don't send controllers during seek if part or track muted or off.
        - Midi: Send controllers during seek only if a change occurred - but force sending if at position 0, or value exists at current position.
        - ALSA Revert: Removed recent MidiAlsaDevice::playEventFifo. Hm, too cautious? 
        - Midi sync: Removed redundant and too-early 'continue' commands. Audio::startRolling already properly does this when sync 'ready to roll'.
        - Midi: Fixed timing error. MEvent::operator<()  Put same-time note-ons after controllers so that program comes before notes! (For example).
        - Jack Midi: Fixed timing error: Reserve multi-events at same frame-time, NOT at successive frames. (Otherwise nightmare to sort stuff.)
        - Midi Revert: Re-installed ALSA sequencer thread SEQM_SEEK and SEQM_STOP, and revert code to call them from audio thread. 
          TODO: Option "Don't use ALSA midi". Midi thread gets in the way of Jack. But ironically ALSA + long-period Audio timing currently best!
        - Midi sync: Song saving: Fixed slight typo saving MMC sync: Was using MRT not MMC.
26.01.2012:
        - Fixed crash with drag/drop copying plugins when their gui was open (rj)
        - Fixed mid clicking to change aux value (rj)
25.01.2012:
        - Fixed some focus stealing that prevented shortcuts from working for Snap dialog and Plugin rack (rj)
24.01.2012:
        - Removed QT_USE_QTNSPLUGIN from CMakeLists.txt (rj)
15.01.2012:
        - Added instrument definitions for "KORG microSTATION" sent
          in by Marko Nikolic (flo)
14.01.2012:
        - Added "write topwin state" checkbox (flo)
12.01.2012:
        - Added Czech translation from Pavel Fric (rj)
11.01.2012:
        - Complain more if timing source isn't good enough (rj)
10.01.2012:
        - Store default style so we can do an immediate recall when setting 'keep system style' (rj)
07.01.2012:
        - Added choice to keep system GUI style (rj)
07.01.2012:
        - Fixed compile errors if not configured for OSC or DSSI. (Tim)
07.01.2012:
        - MusE 2.0 release candidate 2 released (rj)
06.01.2012:
        - added super-glue feature (flo)
03.01.2012:
        - ADDED NEW STYLE DRUM TRACKS: (flo93)
          
          multiple tracks can be displayed in one editor
          their drum sound columns can be reordered, mixed up, hidden.
          drumtracks can be grouped by channel, not at all, or maximally
          each track owns its own drummap
          added drummap-definitions to instrument files (gs and xg.idf)
          drumtracks' drummap can be automatically set according to
          the currently used patch/program/bank
          new-style-drumtracks can ignore muted, hidden or both sounds when
          recording

          KNOWN ISSUES: when having multiple drumeditors open, the mute-column
                        may not work, because another editor is overriding this.
                        this is not a bug.
        
        - Global Cut: Fixed crashes with markers. Re-did marker section in structure.cpp:adjustGlobalLists(). (Tim)
          TODO: Still get tempo, key, and sig not found warnings.
02.01.2012:
        - Fixed drag and drop cloning parts - bad reference count in PartCanvas::moveItem(). (Tim) 
        - File Open dialog: Start with song data and configuration.
        - Don't auto-open ALSA Midi Through device. Fixes "midi write error: Resource temporarily unavailable".
31.12.2011:
        - 'Duplicate tracks' route copying now works, including Audio Input/Output Jack routes. (Tim)
30.12.2011:
        - Added 'Duplicate tracks' Edit action, and dialog. Post-cleanups. TODO: Copy plugins, fix copying parts. (Tim)
          Class Track, and some of it descendants, have fixed copy constructors, and a new assign() method.
          Tested copy constructors and the new assign() method using the new duplicate tracks feature: Good so far, + undo/redo.
        - Fixed compile errors when configured without OSC. Tested OK. Reported by Philippe Macaire. (Tim)
27.12.2011:
        - Fixed some undo/redo/close crashes. TODO Global cut crashes from null Marker. (Tim. All marked p4.0.46)
          Fixed some issues with track list and popup 'name edit' and 'channel spinbox'. Added to audio tracks. 
          REPLACED Undo type ModifyTrack: Two simpler 'ModifyTrackName', 'ModifyTrackChannels' type/struct/functions.
          Some work was done in undo/redo and a couple of slight apparent leaks were fixed in evdata.h
21.12.2011:
        - Fixed some mixer issues: Very slow updating with large mixer when setting visible tracks for example: Set and check 
           Style() object name in MusE::loadTheme() so that slow mixer ScrollArea::viewportEvent() is not called every time.  (Tim...)
          Split strips and amixer into configChanged() and songChanged() handling. Do not fully rebuild mixers upon configChanged().
          Fixed mixer windows raising above others, even briefly: Do not raise mixer windows in MusE::focusInEvent().
        - Fixed bigtime leak: Not destroyed. Give it a parent in MusE::showBigtime().
20.12.2011:
        - Little break for some polish. Route button icons. Rebuild midi track info ui file - was 3 columns not 2. (Tim)
        * Fixed: Hopefully, finally: Non-appearing track info scroll bar.  (Tim)
                 Simple movement of recursive call of sb->setVisible() to end of TLLayout::setGeometry(). 
        - Audio strip prefader now controls audio. (Tim)
18.12.2011:
        * Fixed: Annoying ladspa browser issues. Leak: Dialog was not destroyed. Sorting. Save complete state. (Tim)
17.12.2011:
        - Fixed long-time graphics corruption issue: Large areas of desktop erased to background.  (Tim...) 
          Fixed class RoutePopupMenu. Now a subclass of PopupMenu. Changed all usages to 'short-lived' ::exe(), 
           no more single 'long-life' pointer in class MusE. That should allow multiple instances, using ::popup(). 
          Also fixed class PopupMenu. Tested all submenu and item destructors - OK, everything destroyed on close. 
        - Fixed TList::ColorMenu parenting. Pass it a parent from TList::mousePressEvent. 
        - If Jack is running but no Jack midi devices were found at start, auto-fill with ALSA just to give something.
        * Fixed: Some relief from mixer strip and midi track info bloated size. (Tim)
          Changed default strip font size from 8 to 7. Changed icon sizing - just let strip layout do its thing, instead of forcing size. 
          Changed default style sheet to blank. Was causing problems with track info font size. 
          Fixed mixer: Rebuild mixer upon config font changes.
          Re-arranged some font usages. Updated descriptive tooltips on font entry boxes.
          Re-claimed font#5 as a 'small bold' font for things like markers.
16.12.2011:
        * New: Midi routing matrix! No more clumsy routing menu items. Currently for Midi Track iR and Audio Input iR solo routes. (Tim)
14.12.2011:
        - Corrected FSF address in ladspa.h and vam/COPYING. (Orcan)
12.12.2011:
        * Improved: Midi ports list now fills automatically at start. (Marked as p4.0.41 Tim...)
          An effort to help new users and others. If auto-filling the mid ports proves too much or unpopular, a simple change
           will keep them out of the list, yet still auto-create and auto-connect Jack midi devices, which is still better than before.
          Even if and when 'set and forget' configuration is added, this initial filling step may be welcome for new users.
          NOTE: Virtually impossible to 'auto-pair' together Jack midi inputs and outputs. But I'm working on it, some code in there...
        - When opening a song, choosing only 'Song data', without configuration, now does not upset the midi configuration at all, 
           yet controller data was attempted to be kept - may need to remove that effort.
        - Moved start song loading into main.cpp, with helper in app.cpp. Disabled Florian's 'hackish loader', may be fixed now - TO BE TESTED!. 
        - List only writeable ports in track list output port column and midi track info combo box.
        - Jack midi devices now save an additional required rwFlags xml tag.
        - ALSA Midi fixes: (Un)subscription errors. Delete our simple port! Unsubscribe from announce port. Ignore SND_SEQ_PORT_CAP_NO_EXPORT 
           ports like 'qjackctrl' or 'port'. TODO: Possibly auto-assign newly discovered devices to available midi ports, in alsaScanMidiPorts().
        - Hack: "Midi Through" ALSA and Jack devices pushed to end of list, and list sorted, so useful outputs appear first. 
        - Stopped our own ALSA client from appearing as Jack midi alsa_pcm device.
10.12.2011:
        - More improvements to project save dialog. And tries to suggest parent folder if saving existing project. (Tim...)
        - Midi ports dialog: Auto dis/connect the stated default channels when selecting a device. 
09.12.2011:
        - Fixed popup menu behaviour with (nonstandard!) checkable submenus (flo)
        - Fixed wrong START_DRAG when clicking on popup-columns (flo)
06.12.2011:
        - Fixed drawing of logarithmic values (god how I hate these conversions!..!$%) hopefully...
          should be improved by precalulating max and min values (rj)
05.12.2011:
        - Complete Spanish translation from Cristian Ramos (rj)
03.12.2011:
        * Improved: Project save dialog: Now has quick save as Template. Separate project/result paths shown. Editable project folder. (Tim...)
        * Added: Project directory in global settings dialog. 
        * Added: Untitled project unique names.
        - Fixed bug saving compressed files with spaces in name, in filedialog.cpp fileOpen().
          More work in progress... 
02.12.2011:
        * Added: Project creation dialog now has file type combobox (.med, .med.gz, .med.bz2) (Tim)
        * Fixed: Remaining bugs with Header saving and loading (ex track, drum list header). (Tim)
                 Made two slight fixes in Header::writeStatus and readStatus. Tested thoroughly OK.
01.12.2011:
        - Removed global settings User Instruments dir. Now fixed to muse config. Support for old files included. (Tim...)
        - Changed:  In File Dialog, 'User' initial prepend path changed to muse ./config path. So user files + templates are shown.
        - Fixed: Template directory changed from /home/templates to muse config directory. Support for old files included.
        - Moved QSocketNotifier from Audio::Audio into MusE::MusE.
        - Fixed mixer and main geometry restoration. Moved ahead of doReadGlobalConfig check. 
        - Work In Progress! More to follow...
28.11.2011:
        *Fixed: DSSI synth audio inputs. This means dssi vocoders, samplers etc. should work now. (Tim...)
        *Re-write: Fixed audio mixing, meter processing. Audio, and meters, for all mono <-> stereo route combinations work sensibly now.
        - Do not apply the track pan or volume to extra synth channels above 2.
        - (Re-)fixed valgrind 'invalid read size' in node.cpp, my very-old bad. Moved temp stack buffers to top. (Thnx to Flo)
        - Window titles of ladspa and dssi plugins now have track name prefix to help identify them.
        
        - Added "Unused Devices" menu to the arranger's port popupmenu for rapid device selection (flo)
28.11.2011:
        - MusE 2.0 release candidate 1 released (rj)
27.11.2011:
        - fixed invalid read problem in node.cpp: replaced the (ab-)use
          of a temporary stacked buffer (which was deleted too soon)
          by the use of a temporary heap buffer (new[])   (flo)
26.11.2011:
        - Added config properties for add-track menu, show all, show only visible and property for making visible what you add (rj)
        - Split behaviour and style configuration to two tabs (rj)
        - Adding invisible tracks no longer update track-info in arranger (rj)
        - clicking the background in tracklist and arranger no longer clear focus (rj)
        - moved configuration items for track visibility to global config (rj)
        - Added right click quit to channel strips (rj)
25.11.2011:
        - fixed segfault when closing and SndFileList had more than 1 entry (flo)
        - fixed some mismatched deletes (delete vs delete[]) (flo)
24.11.2011:
        - Fixed: xml song loading ignores very large text such as with Hexter-DSSI. Reported by jphaenlin. (Tim)
          Changed all local buffers to QByteArray (for unlimited size). Test OK loading/saving large songs + Hexter-DSSI.
        - Fixed "Invalid Read/Write"-bug with moving parts past the song's end or past the last track. (flo93)
          The problem was: when the song was automatically enlargened / a new track has automatically been
                           created, the song was update()d, and thus songChanged() was called. Within
                           songChanged(), the PartCanvas clearDelete()d its items list, deleting every
                           data pointed to by that list. However, right after that, the current loop's
                           CItem* is still used (which has just been deleted, that is, invalidated.).
                           In case the loop will go on, there would be even more similar errors.
          Solution: - Added UndoOp::ModifySongLen-action, and used that one for altering song length.
                    - changed Song::addTrack() to write into operation groups.
                      adapted all code using Song::addTrack() accordingly
                    - changed PartCanvas::moveItem() to support whole lists of operations.
        - Fixed a small unused-parameter warning (flo)
        - Updated broken (but unused) UndoOp::typeName() function (flo)
                    
23.11.2011:
        - Fundamental audio engine fixes/changes together with a variety of other fixes. (Tim...)
        - Process track and plugin dssi controls always now, even if off. Fixed problems adjusting/saving gui values. TODO: Dssi when off.
        - User is now forbidden to do circular routing. Routing menu items are now disabled according to whether they would cause a loop.
          Installed anti-circular routing mechanism, allows processing should a circular route actually exist (old files, bugs, deliberate? etc). 
        - Fixed jack.cpp: Connecting routes. Some code was not checking if routes were JACK_ROUTE types, leading to errors.
        * Fixed: Soloing system problems. Forgot to solo-chain all the way back to a midi track. Also fixed crashes if soloing a circular route.
        * Fixed: Aux Tracks. They should 'just work' always now. Required major processing-order changes and routing path support/checking.
          NOTE: Cannot use a track's aux sends if the track has an input route path from ANY Aux Track! Aux knobs/labels now DISABLED in that case.
22.11.2011:
        - Increased contrast for midi event drawing in parts (rj)
21.11.2011:
        - added super-glue feature (flo)
17.11.2011:
        - Fixed all arranger/pianoroll/drumedit keyboard scrolling. (Tim)
          Changed PartCanvas and EventCanvas ::keyPress() key scrolling sections. Plus custom behavior tweaks in each case.
16.11.2011:
        - Ctrl+click or middle button now sets an absolute value for Knobs (as good as possible without advanced arithmetic) (rj)
        - Structure operations: Split,Cut,Insert now work on audio tracks. The previous functionality with operating on selected
          tracks have been split into separate menu items (rj)
15.11.2011:
        - Fixed wacky arranger part selection via KB when 'Move single armed track with selection' set. (Tim)
          Arranger::songChanged() was way too liberal, esp calling partsChanged(). Side benefit: Arranger speed-ups.
        - Changed internal 'undo' shortcut from ctrl-y to standard shift-ctrl-z. (Tim)
14.11.2011:
        - Fixed: Do not clear midi ports upon 'new' (template) or 'import midi'. (Tim)
          Enabled some old code with which I had problems before, but that was long before 'clearing' fixes. 
          Remaining TODOS: 'New' Synth.med template still replaces existing midi ports, and only
           the first port appears to be auto-connected to inputs upon import midi.
        - fixed ScoreEdit bug: names are removed from the set on close and on delete. (Flo)
        - indentation fixes in scoreedit.cpp,h and cobject.cpp (Flo)
        - Removed 18.06.2011 experiment. Do not allow Synths to route to midi track inputs. (Tim) 
          It worked with MESS so far, allowed recording gui control movement. May prove useful 
           in future, but is a big auto-routing hassle ATM. Sections marked p4.0.35.
13.11.2011:
        - ScoreEdit now saves some default init values (flo)
        - seems like this fixed some valgrind bugs as well (flo)
12.11.2011:
        - fixed "newly created subwins aren't focussed" problem (flo)
        - when closing a subwin, automatically another (topmost) subwin 
          gets activated (flo)
        - fixed "non-subwin topwin-states aren't restored when using
          'muse2 songfile.med'. (don't know who, probably Tim)
11.11.2011:
        -  Fixed all template .med song files. (Tim)
10.11.2011:
        - Updated spanish translation by Cristian Ramos (rj)
        - Fixed meters not updating upon vertically shrinking arranger. (Tim)
        - Fixed TopWin xml errors such as "MusE: unknown tag <topwin [or tool or arranger] > at line xxxx". (Tim)
          Used new TopLevelList::findType() in MusE::readToplevels() to find arranger, marker, and cliplist. Was broken !
          So, arranger now remembers its settings (mostly).
          TODO: Fix broken default.med file, has serious xml errors. For long time MarkerView hasn't recalled its visibility.
09.11.2011: 
        - Further to 02.11.2011: Automatically convert old songs to use new 'fluid_synth' name.  (Tim...)
        - Added enum Synth::Type (MESS_SYNTH, DSSI_SYNTH etc) and used it throughout, ex. in findSynth(), also in song file.
          Protects from name conflicts with future MESS, DSSI synths, and simplifies adding future types (say LV2 etc.)
        - Simplified populateAddSynth(), made it agnostic. No more hard-coded synth type sorting - uses Synth::Type now. 
        - Fixed settings synth config lists not updated when 'Remove Instance' clicked. Also now shows the type in the lists. 
        - Fixed regression: No synthesizer patch names were listed.
07.11.2011:
        - fixed restore-window-state bug (flo)
        - fixed dialog translation problem (flo)
        - Updated spanish translation by Cristian Ramos (rj)
06.11.2011:
        - auto-expand fix (flo)
        - NoteInfo-toolbar fix (flo)
04.11.2011:
        - more valgrind fixes (flo)
02.11.2011:
        - Fixed new runtime errors "undefined symbol fluid_synth_cc" and "fluid_synth_set_reverb", seen on Ubuntu 11.10 (Tim).
          MusE "fluidsynth.so" module renamed "fluid_synth.so". Error seems due to required cmakelists LINK_FLAGS line, now removed. 
          Also removed required LINK_FLAGS line in fluid cmakelists.  
          PLEASE REMOVE THE OLD fluidsynth.so ! Or uninstall muse before installing again.
01.11.2011:
        - Fixed Shortcut translations (flo)
        - Added a QSplitter to the shortcut dialog (flo)
31.10.2011:
        - Translation code fixes and added almost-complete German translation (flo)
28.10.2011:
        - Slight fix of midi SMF 1 export. Include meta 0x01 text event comment. (Tim)
        - Added Automation header in Song::execMidiAutomationCtlPopup().
        - Code comments cleanup in Song. 
27.10.2011:
        - Adapt context menu in arranger after what track types are currently visible there
          Now it only allows to create the track types which are set to be visible (rj)
        - Uninitialized value fixes in ScoreEdit (flo)
26.10.2011:
        - Changed visibility of utility tracks so they are not seen by default in arranger (rj)
        - Added a default audio connection in default.med (rj)
        - More memory access fixes (flo)
24.10.2011:
        - Fixed bug #3293339: Midi file export SMF format 0 broken. (Tim)
          Removed erroneous extra 2 bytes. Allow metas in SMF0 in MidiFile::writeEvent().
          Fixed very weird timing issue MidiFile::write(). See comments there (hidden problems lurking still?). 
          Use single MidiFileTrack for SMF0 in MusE::exportMidi(). Added info to export dialog indicating that 
           SMF 0 grabs the track name and comment from first midi track in arranger. Iterate full tracks list 
           instead of midis list in MusE::exportMidi(), so that user can rearrange tracks on the fly before exporting. 
          Some not fully understood useage of meta 0x0F/0x01 text events in MusE::exportMidi(). Hopefully correct...
        - Memory access fixes (flo)
22.10.2011:
        - Catch return in spin boxes and move focus away (rj)
21.10.2011:
        - rename fix (flo)
20.10.2011:
        - Added missing triplets in quantisation dialog (rj)
16.10.2011:
        - Fixed crashes reloading songs having open editors. Previous memleak fixes revealed some problems. (Tim)
          Installed bool TopWin::deleting(). It is set true when closeEvent() is called in any self-deleting TopWins.
          Used it to make all such TopWins and their corresponding child canvasses ignore songChanged signals.
          Test OK so far, multiple reloads of song with all track types, all windows open.
14.10.2011:
        - Fixed keyboard navigation in tracks to work with hidden tracks (rj)
12.10.2011:
        - Made the plugins aware of namespaces. (Orcan)
11.10.2011:
        - Fixed the build of experimental rhythm generator. (Orcan)
09.10.2011:
        - Fixed track list midi port popup menu - too many ports listed. Separated empty ports into submenu. (Tim)
06.10.2011:
        - SigEdit, up/down arrow in denominator only moves between powers of two (decreased thick headedness), 
          numerator is no longer validated (rj)
        - Hopefully last big namespace update. The only namespaces in use are 
            o MusEGlobal: For global variables
            o MusECore:   For non-gui classes
            o MusEGui:    For gui classes
          One or two more namespaces will be added for the stuff outside the main tree (synti, al, etc) (Orcan)
        - Fixed python control add-on building. Left it off by default. (Orcan)
05.10.2011:
        - SigEdit, up/down arrow in denominator only moves between powers of two, 2,4,8...128 (rj)
04.10.2011:
        - More fixes to SigEdit, close on enter, navigate with arrows and / between values, fixed background color, focus (rj)
02.10.2011:
        - SigEdit reworked to use two spinboxes, plan on adding Enter/Return detection so the widget will close when 
          Enter/Return is pressed (rj)
        - Fixed HUGE massive memory leaks in all things using CItemList, and SndFile, dssi, fluidsynth and other huge leaks. (Tim) 
          Addition of 'delete' in places hopefully does not introduce any new unforseen instabilities.
          Result: A song with 20 wave/midi tracks and several dssi, vst and fluidsynths, which leaked HUNDREDS of megabytes,
           now only leaks about 2 megabytes. TODO: Still some funny business with ALSA, and dssi scanning.  
          Post-fix LEAK SUMMARY: definitely lost: 259,863 bytes in 356 blocks   indirectly lost: 611,874 bytes in 22,834 blocks
                                 possibly lost: 180,508 bytes in 5,211 blocks   still reachable: 1,061,068 bytes in 10,522 blocks
30.09.2011:
        - Fixed long-standing problem with themes (Ia Ora / Bespin etc) and MusE button icons. Some themes don't support 
           multiple-pixmap icons. So mute/solo/rec/stereo/thru always showed the same icon. Replaced w single pm icons. (Tim)
        - Fixed midi strip blank automation box at bottom, too high. (Tim)
        - Gradient for strip labels. (Hm, too pastel? Had to go top-high. Maybe change colours again Orcan, he he...) (Tim)  
        - Repaired some non-virtual paintEvent(), resizeEvent(), event() etc. (Tim)
28.09.2011:
        - Optimization: Orcan's meters are insanely lightning-fast now.  (Tim)
          TODO: Fix very slight oversize at bottom upon first showing of mixer.  Workaround: Simply resize vertically.
          TODO: Redo the VerticalMeter (actually Horz) drawing, else should be easy Horz integration into existing Meter class.
21.09.2011:
        - Drawing speed boosts in part canvas. TODO Fix slight dashed border shifting. Do 'hidden' polygons (Tim)
        - Working on meter speed. WIP. Can enable by commenting out #define _USE_NEW_METERS in meter.cpp (Tim) 
          Combined with part canvas fixes, meter work so far makes MusE2 near-Muse1 speed when playing big songs
           with many active mixer strip meters.
20.09.2011:
        - Revert the change in coloring of the selected track in tlist. Making full transpaency optional
          requires more substantial changes. (Orcan)
        - Update the default config file with the same defaults as in gconfig.cpp. Question: Why do we
          have defaults defined in multiple places? (Orcan)
17.09.2011:
        - Minor namespace fix in osc.cpp. (Orcan)
16.09.2011:
        - Fixed errors when ladspa plugins not found while loading. (Tim)
        - Fixed forgotten bool to pointer conversion in some calls to song::addTrack, createSynthI. (Tim)
14.09.2011:
        - added sane configuration defaults to muse (flo93)
        - several minor fixes (flo93)
        - added MDI-like and borland-like user interface (flo93)
        - improved pasting, added dialogs, added "copy in range",
          changed shortcut keys (flo93)
        - New namespaces MusEArranger and MusEMixer. (Orcan)
        - Updated default track colors on arranger. Indicate the selected track with a gradient instead of a
          separate color. (Orcan)
        - moved colorRect() and get_paste_len() into utils.cpp. (Orcan)
        - Updated default colors of transport handles, bigtime foreground, waveedit background, track labels.
          Made them more pastelish, easier on eyes. (Orcan)
        - Made horizontal alignment of meter and slider in mstrip consistent with in astrip. (Orcan)
13.09.2011:
        *Added: You can now insert new tracks instead of always at the track list end. (Tim)
          If main menu 'Add track': Inserts before currently selected track, else adds at end.
          If Track List right-click existing Track Name: New 'Insert track' menu inserts before clicked track.
          If Track List right-click on empty space, or Mixer 'Create': Adds at end, as usual.
        - Fixed track selection bug: Track info panel not clearing when clicking empty area. (Tim)
          Added an emit selectionChanged(0) in TList::mousePressEvent.
        - Observed: Ancient bug: Track Info doesn't change if selecting multiple tracks in reverse order.
          Will need to be fixed if/when adding 'multiple track global editing'. 
        - Made Slider::sizeHint() a const function again, so that the plugin window respects its sizeHint. (Orcan)
        - Explicitly disabled the scale support in Slider since it wasn't really in use for a while. (Orcan)
11.09.2011:
        - Rewrote the rounding function for efficientcy. Moved the function into utils.cpp since it is written
          for general purpose. (Orcan)
        - The rounding in the meter is done in paintEvent now. I also enabled Antialiasing to make the corners
          look nicer. Therefore I had to comment out Qt::WA_OpaquePaintEvent attributes in the meter and the
          verticalmeter for now. Some testing needed. (Orcan)
        - Plugin slider color codes are now generated from plugin ID numbers. (Orcan)
        - Active plugins are colored in green in the rack. (Orcan)
09.09.2011:
        - Removed sending of SEQM_ADD_TRACK, SEQM_REMOVE_TRACK, SEQM_CHANGE_TRACK, SEQM_REMOVE_PART, and 
           SEQM_CHANGE_PART to ALSA midi thread (which waits) from inside Audio::processMsg.
          Replaced with hand-offs to Song::processMsg. TODO: SEQM_SET_TRACK_OUT_CHAN etc. (Tim)
        - MidiDevice play and stuck event lists no longer directly accessible from outside -
           replaced with ::addScheduledEvent and ::addStuckNote. (Tim)
        - Installed a ring buffer for ALSA MidiDevice play/stuck notes event lists, filled by ::addScheduledEvent 
           and ::addStuckNote, because ALSA midi is processed in a thread other than audio. (Tim)
          TODO: processMidi could do stuck notes better by bypassing their insertion in the play event list,
                 also applies to seek/stop handler block, but I'm not sure about the time comparisons.   
        - Removed MidiSeq::msgSeek and ::msgStop, and removed calls from Audio::seek and ::stopRolling. (Tim) 
          Removed Audio::msgShowInstrumentGui and ::msgShowInstrumentNativeGui.
        - Some more separation of ALSA and Jack Midi, one step closer to configurable choice of either/or. (Tim)
        - Massive cleanup of audio, midi, mididev, alsamidi, jackmidi, dssi modules. Moved some stuff from 
           Audio::processMidi into MidiDevice. (Tim)
        - Test OK here so far, with stress files and complete pre-existing songs, ALSA, Jack, and Synth midi. (Tim)
          TODO: Restoration of sustain upon play seems broken for a while - try putEvent instead of addScheduledEvent
           in Audio::startRolling().
        - Cleaned some namespace change artifacts. Fixed signal/slot mechanism related to bigtime, pianoroll,
          drumedit. Fixed config file corruption. (Orcan)
        - Made plugin slider colors fancy, experimental. (Orcan)
08.09.2011:
        - Finished namespace MusEWidget. Added namespaces MusEUtil, MusEDialog. (Orcan)
07.09.2011:
        - Introducing namespaces. So far, we have MusEApp, MusEGlobal, MusEConfig, and I just started
          MusEWidget. zynaddsubfx does not crash anymore. (Orcan)
06.09.2011:
        - Add licensing information (GPLv2 or later) to source code files. Update FSF mailing address
          to the most recent one in the existing copyright notices. (Orcan)
05.09.2011:
        - Remodel the EffectRack. There is still an ongoing issue with the minimumSizeHint, which I worked
          around by adding a fixed offset. (Orcan)
        - Fall back to using Meter's own size functions rather than the event rectangle's size functions
	  in paintEvent(). The latter caused corruption when toggling mono/stereo. (Orcan)
04.09.2011:
        - Remodel the Slider (Orcan)
        - moved and changed muse.pro file (flo93)
        - added update_pro.sh and update_translations.sh (flo93)
        - added paste dialog (flo93)
        - updated translations (flo93)
        - moved stuff from functions.cpp out to dialogs.cpp (flo93)
        - fixed behaviour of movePartsTotheRight(): parts which
          begin at "start of move" aren't expanded, but moved now (flo93)
01.09.2011:
        - Fixed tough old skeleton: Selecting 'previous/next event' in Song::execAutomationCtlPopup now moves cursor
           with exact frame resolution, all the way through via proper song->setPos > audio->msgSeek rather than
           song->setPos > set pos[0] etc. There was a bug that it got stuck on too-close points on the graphs. (Tim) 
        - Reverted controls to full speed (again): Removed too-cautious msgSetVolume, msgSetPan, msgSetPluginCtrlVal. (Tim)
          Reviewing some other possibly unneeded too-cautious msgXXX audio messages :) 
          TODO: Fix current automation values (the 'off' value).
        - Removed unused PanKnob from mixer CMakeLists. (Tim)
29.08.2011:
        - Fixed Robert's fixes (flo93)
        - Fixed audio automation graph editing. And now 'snaps' to discrete integer or bool types. (Tim p4.0.32)
          All control movements should update display now. Also slightly changed behaviour of Ctrl class. 
          TODO: Fix some painting corruption, improve discrete display, add transparency etc. etc.
        - Applied compilation patch to rhythmbase.ui by Jean-Damien Durand. (Tim)
28.08.2011:
        - Fixed weird column expansion for [rec] column by removing autoexpand of the last column. Still
          something fishy with moving columns (rj)
27.08.2011:
        - Changed mousewheel behaviour, vertical scrolling is default and horizontal scrolling (shift) is reversed (rj)
        - Added fullscreen shortcut to all editors which have full screen action (rj)
        - Part text editor now closes when focus is lost (rj)
17.08.2011:
        - Convert some Qt3 style coding in ComboBox to Qt4 in terms of menu entry handling. (Orcan)
        - Add mouse wheel support to ComboBox. (Orcan)
        - Fix AutoType indicator coloring. (Orcan)
16.08.2011:
        - More drawing fixes, improved accuracy (grids, timescales, edges, markers guaranteed to align now). (Tim p4.0.30)
          Much drawing changed to device (pixel) space instead of virtual space, for accuracy.
        - Fixed display of audio automation graphs. (But not editing). (Tim) 
        - Fixed unreadable Master Edit tempo scale (on left side), and added toolbar saving and restoring. (Tim p4.0.31)
15.08.2011:
        - Remodel the Meter and the VerticalMeter (Orcan)
13.08.2011:
        - Make the shininess of the Knob ring a little smarter (Orcan)
05.08.2011:
        - Parts having hidden events now drawn using 'jagged' ends and special white edges. (Tim p4.0.29)
        - Improved border drawing guaranteed to show L/R touching part borders. TODO: Top and bottom borders. (Tim)
        - Muted parts now show names and events. Filled with a special brush pattern for easy recognition. (Tim)   
        - Huge changes to PartCanvas::drawItem(). And to all View::XmapXXX methods for better accuracy. (Tim)
        - Changed bool Part::hasHiddenNotes() to int Part::hasHiddenEvents(). Added int Part::cachedHasHiddenEvents(). (Tim)
02.08.2011:
        - Changed behaviour of part clones (flo93)

31.07.2011:
        - Remodel the Knob (Orcan)

28.07.2011:
        - speeded up structural operations (flo93)
        - fixed several heavy bugs in structural operations: (flo93)
           - global insert freezed muse
           - global cut and global insert behaved wrong on parts not
             starting at the zeroth tick
           - fixed upper_bound vs. lower_bound issues
        - clicking below the track list now deselects all tracks (flo93)
        - moved checkRegionNotNull() where it belongs (flo93)
14.07.2011:
        - Fixed loading of old songs with synths. (Tim)
          Added static keyword to array in each synth's oldMidiStateHeader() member. 
27.06.2011:
        - Massively speeded up muse by using operation groups (flo93)
        - Changed behaviour of middle click in all canvases to "delete" (flo93)
21.06.2011:
        - Fixed wave editor position and marker drawing corruption. (Tim)
        - Updated Yamaha m06 IDF file to version 4 by Geoff King. (Tim)
18.06.2011:
          (By Tim. Marked as p4.0.27)
        - Major work, all synthesizers. Sysexes now wrapped in a header MFG ID (0x7c) + synth ID. Fixed leaks, crashes. 
          Each MESS synth (or just the single DSSI host) now has a unique ID, used in the sysex header.
          TODOS: Finish DeicsOnze::getControllerInfo. Fix Fluid - must set to High Bank #2 to see any patch names!
          *NOTE: Some data will now change upon saving a song! Compatibility with old songs is built-in and transparent.
                 Ask Tim for details. 
        *Feature: SimpleDrums now FULLY functional including effects. Support old songs + MusE-1 songs, tested OK. 
        - Fluid soft synth now remembers and displays the font name.
        - Fixed midi TrackInfo patch name not initializing at position 0 even when value stored, with FluidSynth (possibly others). 
        - Fixed some leaks, lack of dtors cleanup call when repeatedly loading songs. Should be a weee bit more stable now. 
        - EXPERIMENT: Midi track input routes can now come from any of the synthesizers! This is a WIP and might change or disappear.
06.06.2011:
        - removed (unused) support for disabling the keymap (flo93)
04.06.2011:
        - fixed regression with switching ctrl/shift when manipulating
          items in canvas. drag+shift limits movement, drag+ctrl copies (rj)
        - changed behaviour of middle click in all canvases to "delete" (flo93)
02.06.2011:
        - the score editor now allows batch-movements, that is,
          you can transpose or move the whole selection and not
          only single notes (flo93)
        - the functions now return as boolean, if they have triggered
          undo (flo93)
        - applied another patch from WillyFoobar: moved Q_OBJECT
          to the top of each class definition, where it belongs (flo93)
30.05.2011:
        - implemented cut,copy'n'paste and the "select foo" entries in the score editor (flo93)
        - added select_foo() functions to functions.cpp (flo93)
        - removed "midi in" button from score editor (flo93)
        - added a spinbox to the arranger's "Ch:" column (flo93)
29.05.2011:
        - moved cut,copy'n'paste to functions.cpp, removed unnecessary duplication (flo93)
        - changed behaviour of paste: now the pasted, not the original notes are selected (flo93)
28.05.2011:
        - fixed dragging and resizing of track header, also changed default index of new 
          sections, they should appear last now (rj)
        - fixed the buggy bugfix of the "invalid Part*s" bug (flo93)
27.05.2011:
        - fixed bug in scoreeditor: invalid Part*s are now not used any more (flo93)
        - applied some hunks of the patch sent in by WillyFoobar (flo93)
25.05.2011:
        - Added midiin and steprec buttons again (flo93)
        - Added step-rec-support for drum edit and score edit (flo93)
        - put step-rec-stuff into its own class (flo93)
        - moved clefTypes out of scoreedit.h to prevent compile-horror (flo93)
        - Declared struct Route as QMetaType to make it a QVariant type. (Tim)
        - Moved: All routing popup menu stuff from app, astrip, mstrip, mtrackinfo into
           new class RoutePopupMenu, *massively* cleaning up those 4 files. 
          Used the new Route QVariant type as action data instead of integers. 
        - Moved MenuTitleItem definitions from astrip.cpp into it's own menutitleitem.cpp (Tim)  
        - Added to settings: "Make popup menus stay open. Otherwise hold Ctrl." (Tim)   
          To avoid showing new users non-standard behaviour, the default is off!
24.05.2011:
        - Awl::PitchEdit now can be set with the musical keyboard (flo93)
        - fixed y-stretch (flo93)
        - cleaned up step-rec and midi-in buttons and stuff (flo93)
        - steprec now supports a "insert rest" key, which can be set (flo93)
          under Midi -> Input Plugins -> Remote Control
        - song->midiNote now also delivers note off events (flo93)
        - fixed pitch-spinbox (flo93)
        - removed auto-resize from tracklist-header (rj)
        - removed channel from track list for a drum track and grayed it out in track info (rj)
        - fixed samplerate warning from templates (rj)
23.05.2011:   (all changes made by flo93, except one)
    Function-related changes:
        - made all the stuff in the "functions" menu global
        - added crescendo, legato functions, improved erase function
        - removed unnecessary _to and _quant* - stuff from piano roll and drum edit
          this also involved changing the Toolbar1 
        - changed behaviour for step-recording: the note-length is now the "raster"-
          value instead of the "quant"-value
        - changed behaviour for scripts: the "quant"-parameter they get isn't the
          quant-combo's setting, but the snap-combo's now
        - removed unnecessary short cuts: SHRT_OVER_QUANTIZE etc. instead added
          SHRT_QUANTIZE

    Score-Editor-related changes:
        - using the proper AL::raster functions in the score editor
        - added support for selections to the score editor
        - distance between staves is now automatically increased if necessary
        - fixed "change pitch freezes scoreeditor"-bug
        - added clef-combobox to midi tracks (rj and flo)
        - don't install the *.mf files any more
        - added a modified MTScale to the score editor
        
    Other Stuff:
        - speeded up importing midi massively
        - when step-recording, chords can now be entered with only the musical keyboard
        - swapped ctrl and shift behaviour to make muse accord to standards

        - added line tool to drum editor
        - added "reorder list" function to drum roll
        - changed ctrl-edit's behaviour when control key is pressed
        
20.05.2011:
        - Popup menus: If stay-open mode, space triggers item and double-click simulates return (closing). (Tim)
19.05.2011:
        * Feature: Popup menus now auto-scroll if too large to fit on desktop. (p4.0.25 Tim)
          Added auto-scroll to my class PopupMenu. Added selectable stay-open. TODO: Use it more, where needed.
        - Changed midi track info patch popup behaviour. Now stays open for auditioning patches. (Tim)
        - Changed editor 'ctrl' controller popups. Split instrument/other (+ common controls!) + show ctrl numbers. (Tim)
          TODO: Add custom (R)NRPN dialog to 'other' section.
15.05.2011:
        - Changed mouse wheel behaviour in graphical editors except the score editor (rj)
            * wheel scrolls left-right
            * shift+wheel scrolls up-down
            * control+wheel zooms horizontally
            TODO:
             - score editor
             - zoom to where the mouse is located
14.05.2011:
        - Fixed problem with project save dialog missing a forward slash '/'. (Tim)
          ~/.config was being polluted with wrong folders. Fixed ProjectCreateImpl::updateDirectoryPath().
13.05.2011:
        - New spanish translation from Cristian Ramos (rj)
        - Added dialog to remove unused wave files (rj)
        - Changed default imported midi song type to GM. (Tim)
        - Added GM drums patch in MidiInstrument::populatePatchPopup() for GM songs on ch 10. (Tim)
12.05.2011: 
        - Changed template song "default.med" song type from NO to GM, to help new users. (Tim)
10.05.2011: 
        - Added general settings audio item: Minimum control process period 1-2048, default 64. Test OK. (Tim)
          Adjusts minimum allowable number of samples in a LADSPA or DSSI run, ie control 'smoothness'.
          Still TODO: AudioTrack controllers contribution.
        - Added Yamaha Mo6 instrument file by Geoff King gsking1 A T gmail D O T com. (Tim) 
08.05.2011: 
        - Draw event canvas notes if they extend past part end. (Tim)
        - Added checkbox to select if songinfo should be displayed on song start (rj)
        - fixups to structure functions, now inserts/cuts markers, and master track events with undo (rj)
06.05.2011:
        - MusE 2.0beta2 released (rj)
        - Added Yamaha-CS1x.idf instrument from Ernie Rymer <ethylene77 A T yahoo D O T com> Thanks! (Tim)
          Turned off executable permissions on some others.
05.05.2011:
        - Fixed regression: Plugins would not restore saved control state when loading song. (Tim)
04.05.2011:
        - Fixed meter drawing for zero values in feedback parameters to plugin guis (rj)
02.05.2011:
        - MusE 2.0beta released (rj)
01.05.2011:
        - More fixes, improvements to ladspa and dssi processing, control responsiveness, of 25.04.2011. (Tim)
          Timestamp control ring buffer items with linear Audio::curFrame() instead of circular Audio::timestamp().
          Added Audio::curSyncFrame(), used it in process routines to subtract from timestamp. 
          All effect/synth generic/native gui controls should be quick now. 
        - Dssi synths respond to Audio track controller graphs now. 
          Still TODO: Make Audio track controllers full-speed (like the controls), they are still once per period. 
          Do same for midi->ladspa controller code.
28.04.2011:
        - More separation of Alsa and Jack midi processing. Possible fix for crash report by Geoff B. (p4.0.22 Tim)
          Added MidiDevice::handleStop(), ::handleSeek(). Split processing among MidiSeq::processStop, ::processSeek
           and Audio::stopRolling, ::seek. Also some sustain resetting code and midi sync code was moved into
           these two new MidiDevice methods. 
          TODO: There is more separation to be done. Hopefully it makes MusE more stable and timing-proper. 
        - Small fix to scoredit in color_image(). Use bytesPerLine() * height() for older Qt. Test OK. (Tim)
        - Fix to Robert's DssiSynthIF::paramOut(). Call getParameterOut(). (Tim)
        - Changed all plugin and dssi module's 'unsigned' usage to 'unsigned long' for more consistency. (Tim)
        - fixed multiple connects in master list editor and some cleanups suggested by WillyFooBar (rj)
27.04.2011:
        - added first version feedback parameters for plugins (rj)
        - merged score edit branch into trunk (flo)
25.04.2011:
        - added a songChanged at the end of clear when loading a new song, intended effect was to 
          clear GUI before loading new song to fix some nasty crashes, seems to work (rj)
        - Overhaul plugin.cpp/h: Fix all float <-> double and int <-> unsigned usages. (p4.0.21 Tim)
        - Improved ladspa and dssi controller responsiveness even with large audio buffer size. (Tim)
          Implemented variable run-lengths for frame-accurate controller processing. 
          Improved volume, pan, and plugin control responsiveness - used track->setPluginCtrlVal() 
           instead of audio->msgSetPluginCtrlVal() which waits until next audio process.
          Work in progress! Still not complete yet. Please bear with me. 
24.04.2011:
        - Improved master list editor editing of keys, dropdown should not 'stay behind' anymore (rj)
21.04.2011:
        - Fixed drag&drop plugin instantantiation (again), was using a string pointer to private data
          now copies the data before use (rj)
19.04.2011:
        - Added undo/redo to master list editor for key editing, should implicitly
          mean that SC_KEY is emitted to detect song change (not tested) (rj)
        - fixed bug with undo not working for first signature event (rj)
16.04.2011:
        - Added KeyList for keeping key change events and ability to edit it in
          master list editor (rj)
        - fixed stuff in master list editor (rj)
          * editing tempo signature is now atleast working
          * editing time position is now atleast working
          * double clicking a line moves the playpointer to this position if we are not playing
          * changed adding tempo/sig/key so they pick the position from the play pointer instead
            of just incrementing the time position, I can't fathom when that would be preferable
            (if there is a time, I'm sure someone will let me know :) )
          - song changed not implemented yet
          - undo/redo is not implemented
        - Fixed crash in dssihost.cpp - my bad from recent p4.0.20 changes. (Tim)
        - Added destructors to sigmap and tempomap. Test OK. (Tim)
15.04.2011:
        - And while we're at it... Invert drum track 'slivers' in arranger parts. (Tim)
        - Move part name text to bottom to accommodate drum 'slivers'. 
          Use lowest gradient colour from new gGradientFromQColor(), to determine whether to invert.
14.04.2011:
        - Fixed notes 'sliver' drawing in arranger midi parts. Invert if too dark. (Tim)
        - Gave arranger part name text drawing a shadow to help contrast with drawn events. 
          Also moved part name text out of the way, to top of part. 
        - Removed DSSI gui QProcess kill timers. In Qt4 they can only be used that way with threads started with QThread. 
          Kill is not nice anyway. On terminate, gui may prompt user to save work etc. App should check at close 
           if all these guis closed and ask to abort closing, or kill the guis, or leave them alone.
        - Improved dark part colour gradients. Added gGradientFromQColor() in widgets/utils.cpp and called from PartCanvas draw.
12.04.2011:
        - Another fix for FLAM GUI controls - 300ms delay before sending control values in PluginI::oscUpdate(). (Tim)
          Good enough? How to make sure (any) gui is really ready?
11.04.2011:
        - Possible fix for FLAM GUI controls - send current control values in PluginI::oscUpdate().(Tim)
10.04.2011:
        * Added: Expanded all routing choices: Synth to Wave track, Wave track to Wave track etc. (Tim)
        * Added: DSSI synths can now show generic LADSPA GUI as well as native. (Tim p4.0.20)
          WIP: Controllers not finished + maybe need a chooser for which ones (of possibly 1000's) are shown. 
          I reserved an Audio track controller index of 9 for them. If we ever decide to increase the number 
           of rack plugins, that gives us room for 8 maximum, for now. (But increasing the maximum number
           of controllers would mean altering the list structure, requiring a bump-up of file version.)
        - Dummy audio: Fixed lockups, or crash at line: "while (drvPtr->cmdQueue.size())" in dummy loop. (Tim)  
          Replaced loop code with with muse_qt4_evolution's (usleep-based instead of timer). 
          TODO: Try subtracting process time from sleep time for more accuracy. 
          TODO: Use a better sleep routine - usleep may be have terrible resolution in some cases.
09.04.2011:
        - No more sleep icon when cancelling a quit operation (rj)
        - added Ctrl+Shift+LeftMouseButton to add entire rows to selection in all canvas editors (rj)
01.04.2011:
        - Fixed custom LADSPA DSSI GUI support. Tested OK with FLAM. Thanks to Luis Garrido for help. (Tim)
31.03.2011:
        * Feature: Support for custom LADSPA DSSI GUIs, such as those generated by FLAM. (p4.0.19 Tim)
        - Initial support. TODO: Refine how a particular UI file is chosen - uses first one found for now.
          Also may need to support multiple choices if multiple lib-level and/or plugin-level UIs are found.
27.03.2011:
        - Fixed end/off-screen selections not being drawn in midi controller graphs. (Tim)
        - Reverted Midi Track Info ui layout more or less to pre- Mar 5, with some improvements. (Tim)
        - Added: placeholder for Score editor (rj)
        - Reclaim some screen real estate. Set zero margin and spacing in ScrollScale constructor. (Tim)
        - Fixed midi controller graphs' velocity items selections. (Tim)
24.03.2011:
        - Fixed: Problems with midi event list editor. (p4.0.18 Tim)
          For ex. problems selecting items while pianroll open. Changed ListEdit::songChanged().
        - Fixed: Some problems drawing/editing on pianoroll controller graphs. Also added drawing speed-ups. (Tim)
        - Added: Pianoroll controller graph items can now be selected/highlighted. Sync'd with midi event list editor. (Tim) 
          Just a step towards better editing of controller graphs. WIP (No copy/cut/paste/move yet.)
16.03.2011:
        - Added: Midi events drawing while recording (rj)
        - Fixed, hopefully, MESS synths sometimes being silent (rj)
12.03.2011:
        - Cursor mode in drum editor should be usable now (rj)
          Changes:
          * delete current event with delete
          * change edit step size on toolbar and using 0 and 9
            Try setting step size to 16 with snap 16, place cursor on the first beat for kickdrum
            hold down 'b' to add all kickdrums.
            Now move to snare at position 8 hold down 'b' again.
            A basic beat should now be entered kick/snare/kick/snare
          * auto scrolling of view when event is outside view
          * move current event as with standard event operations
10.03.2011:
        - Added: Say hello to 'CURSOR MODE' in drum editor (rj)
          the idea is to edit drums more like a mod tracker, doing all from the keyboard.
          shortcuts defined for entering cursor mode (U) and V,B,N,M for entering notes.
          TODO: Step parameter, auto scrolling, mouse integration and more
        - color tweaks for wave tracks in arranger (rj)
07.03.2011:
        - draw gradients in arranger (rj)

        - adjust columns and store size of shortcut dialog (rj)
        - Fixed up some missing keyboard accelerators for menus (rj)
01.03.2011:
        - Added feature to show/hide track-types from arranger, this far only with toolbuttons
          and no persistent storage (rj)
        - restore window geometry for Midi configuration dialog (rj)
28.02.2011:
        - Added progress dialog for loading projects (rj)
        - Aligned meters on mixer strip (rj)
27.02.2011:
        - Fixed piano roll controller graph text drawing (finally!). (Tim)
        - Fixed crashes in drag & drop for plugins and drag presets from outside muse into a plugin (rj)
        - Support for multiple drops of files to arranger, e.g easy import of a bunch of wave files (rj)
        - Added some missing Qt headers, found by Flo on Debian Lenny. (Tim)
26.02.2011:
        - Fixed some piano roll controller graph drawing issues. (Tim)
          Draw velocities on top of grid, but draw non-velocity items behind grid.
24.02.2011:
        - Improved default midi auto-connections. (Tim p4.0.17)
          Midi ports list default input routes column now shows 'all' by default.
          Improved and fixed default input and output routes columns.
          With those two columns' popup menus, users can now apply defaults to all existing tracks.
        - Fixed Organ synth crashing. Added setupUi(this) in OrganGui::OrganGui(). (Tim)
        - Fixed synth devices should not be listed as soloing chain popup items. (Tim)
18.02.2011:
        - Disable saveAs dialog for rec when project dialog isn't used (rj)
        - changed the default setting for move single rec with track, default is to NOT move (rj)
        - fixed (hopefully) bug in shortcut editor, global shortcuts were not always
          taken into account when checking if a shortcut was in use (rj)
        - added shortcut F for linedraw, applicable to automation drawing in arranger and pianoroll (rj)
15.02.2011:
        - Automation fixes, better detection, not perfect (rj)
14.02.2011:
        - Fixed midi track info panel layout and spacing. Should be much better now. (Tim)
        - Added patch to remove warnings from WillyFoobar (rj)
        - Fixes to graphical automation (rj)
           * select color in menu
           * offset bug, can now edit automation although it's scrolled down
           TODO redrawing issues when using slider automation for instance.
        - mixer slider now updates canvas to get automation updated (rj)
13.02.2011:
        - restore toolbar locations for main window and editors (rj)
        - fixed some layout issues in general settings (rj)
        - removed window geometry from default template, TODO add a menu option for creating
          templates, which might not contain certain types of data, including geometry (rj)
        - fixed bug if jack zombifies during project load which led to a crash (rj)
        - Fixed MusE failing with non-RT kernel. Now falls back to normal 'OTHER' scheduling. (Tim p4.0.16)
        - Fixed dummy audio thread not running FIFO with RT kernel - set PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED. (Tim p4.0.16)
10.02.2011:
        - added cut/copy/paste and keyboard shortcuts to wave editor (rj)
09.02.2011:
        - fixed regression with Bounce to File and Bounce to Track (rj)
        [[[ By Tim. Marked as p4.0.15 ...
        - Removed MidiDevice::nextPlayEvent, and instead of erasing 'already played events' at top of 
           Audio::processMidi(), let each device erase played events immediately after playing them.
          Still a bit uneasy with this one, but nextPlayEvent was causing some problems. 
          This required forced event erasure, if the track is off, in SynthI::preProcessAlways(),
           which may need more tweaking for other non-processed circumstances.
        - Added MidiDevice::putEventWithRetry() which will wait and retry sending an event. 
          So far it is only used in MidiPort::setMidiDevice(), which runs in the GUI thread where 
           it can wait a bit.
        - Increased playback MidiFifo size from 512 to 2100, to accommodate large block sends, 
           such as in MidiInstrument::reset() which sends 2048 events at once.
          Created new recording MidiRecFifo with reduced size of 160 instead of previous 512.
          Replaced SynthI::putFifo and MidiJackDevice::eventFifo with unified MidiDevice::eventFifo.
          TODO: Allow ALSA devices to also make use of it, in case events cannot be delivered.
        - Added a timestamp to OscControlFifo events. To be used for better, faster OSC processing - TODO.
        - Fixed DSSI processing timing in DssiSynthIF::getData(). Should be much better now, tested OK.
        - Fixed Jack Midi 'lost event' messages due to full buffers. Now it waits until next cycle if buffer is full.
          Slight mod: SysEx events forced to be lost, since it is most likely that the sysex is too big and Jack Midi 
           could never allocate enough space for it, meaning the event would linger around forever attempting to
           be sent, tying up other events. ]]]
08.02.2011:
        - made muse compilable under gcc-4.6. ptrdiff_t type requires inclusion of cstddef. (Orcan)
31.01.2011:
        - added cmake option (-DMODULES_BUILD_STATIC=ON) to build the internal modules
          statically. It should be possible to run muse from the build tree. (Orcan)
        - Moved -fPIC to the global build flags. (Orcan)
26.01.2011:
        - moved automation lines ontop of parts (rj)
        - fixes to automation editing, still many bugs though (rj)
21.01.2011:
        - Added: graphical editing of automation, also now stores which parameters are visible (rj)
                 Edit with new automation tool in arranger, to create new points hold down ctrl.
           TODO: Easy selection of colors, create new points need improvement, and probably a
                 bunch of bugs, drawing does not always work for instance, and some cleaning
17.01.2011:
        - fixed: panic button (rj)
        - fixed: initialization crash when loading a new project (rj)
15.01.2011:
        - fixed: bug were wave track appeared to be rec enabled but no file was created. (rj)
        - made create project dialog optional, also some minor tweaks to the dialog (rj)
        -
09.01.2011:
        - These changes marked as p4.0.14:
        - Applied aux send fix AudioTrack::writeProperties() by Remon. Thanks. (Tim)
        - Fixed very slow midi trackinfo property adjustments with mixer shown. In AudioMixerApp::songChanged(). (Tim)  
        * Feature!: Complete soloing system (after 4 years). Support chaining Midi Port/Audio Out -> Audio In. (Tim)
          Click on audio strip iR, or midi strip oR, or midi track info oR buttons to see new additions.
          Tested thoroughly, but of course this major change needs wider testing. 
          TODO TODO: Fix trackinfo width (a minor button placement gui issue).
        * Some tweaks for automation viewing, more to do. (rj)
04.01.2011:
        - Added saving and restoring of pianoroll trackinfo h-splitter state. (Tim)
        - Fixed multiple velocity controllers appearing on song reload. Tested OK. (Tim)
        - Fixed arranger trackinfo widgets sizing - were allowed to shrink vertically. (Tim)
          TODO: Fix trackinfo scrollbar not showing at right time.
        - Replace all QWidget::setShown() calls with setVisible(). (Tim)
          It's supposed to be a Qt3 function, but still supported.
        - Enabled displaying of audio automation on tracks (rj)
        - Added right-click on track ARM buttons, now enables/disables all tracks of it's kind (rj)
02.01.2011:
        - Fixed arranger focussing problems again. (Tim)
          Scratch setFocusProxy() fix of 31.12. Gave MusE a keyPress handler and pass it on to canvas.
        - Fixed transport +/- position snapping. Works globally now too. (Tim)
          Moves by, and snaps to, snap setting of either an editor, or globally to arranger by default. 
        - Added transport position "Shift + +/-" keys, for no snapping. (Tim)
        - Removed (hopefully) the last bits of Qt3support functions from .ui files. (Orcan)
        - fixed patch loading for deicsonze and reverted to it's standard colortheme (rj)
31.12.2010:
        - Possible fix for arranger focussing problems. (Tim)
          Added parent->setFocusProxy(canvas) just after canvas created.
          Also added to pianoroll.
        - Added shadow behind the wallpaper titles for easier read. (Orcan)
30.12.2010:
        - Suggestion by OOM team: Add default velocity controllers to pianoroll and drum edit. (Tim)
        *Feature: Appearance part color names now can now be edited. (Tim)
          TODO: Add per-song settings and add toolbar with some colour goodies.
        *Feature: Mixer label colours can now be edited in the appearance settings. (Tim)
          TODO: Remix track icons using use alpha channel and special routine to mix in 
           these settable colours.
        *Fixed: Appearance settings palette was broken. (Tim)
          Note: A few odd Qt styles are wacky (Motif, Windows). Your mileage may vary.
        - In ctrl canvas, draw the grid before anything else. (Orcan)
29.12.2010:
        - Fixed Bigtime display when using a style sheet for MusE. (Tim)
          Set window font using a style sheet. Bigtime used QFont::setPixelSize(). 
          Application style sheets (even a blank one) override with the fixed application 
          font size (evidenced by adjusting MusE config font#0, then bigtime font size changed). 
          TODO: Darn, the tooltips fonts are as big as the labels! Must fix.
        - Added 2 wallpapers from Geoff Beasly.
        - Fixed focus stealing of transport (rj)
28.12.2010:
        - Tweaked and added some delays during project load to counter threading
          issues during loading of projects (rj)
        - Commented out the comment placeholder text line in projectcreateimpl.cpp. It
          broke the compilation against Qt-4.7. (Orcan)
        - Fixed the shift modifier issue in renaming parts in the arranger. (Orcan)
        - Fixed the 'no selected track' trackinfo background MusE logo display. (Tim)
          It was a memory leak as well. Was a simple fix in Arranger::genTrackInfo().
27.12.2010:
        - Added a first try at project creation dialog, we'll see how much territory
          it covers, intentionally it's only used upon creation of a project, later 'Save As'
          operations use the old dialog so multiple .med files can be saved for the
          same project (rj)
        - deferred creating *.wav files until the global record button is clicked,
          if a project does not exist at that time, pop up the new project dialog (rj)
        - changed 'new' project from listing PROJECT_VIEW to GLOBAL_VIEW where the
          templates reside, an enhancement would be to list USER_VIEW if it's template
          dir exists (rj)
        - Added myself to the AUTHORS list. Oops. (Orcan)
        - Added a mimetype file for *.med, *.med.gz, *.med.bz2 and associated MusE with this
          mimetype (and also midi and xml mimetypes) in the .desktop file. (Orcan)
        - Got manpages from Debian by Daniel Kobras, and updated them for MusE2. (Orcan)
        - Remove rem'd preview code in filedialog.cpp. I reimplemented it in appearance.cpp. (Orcan)
        - Remove the environment variables info from the usage output. (Orcan)
        - midiedit links to ctrl. (Orcan)
        - Merged changes from ccherrett into pianroll (h-splittter). (Tim)
        - changed open dialog to view stored project directory for PROJECT_VIEW (rj)
        - Fixed midi track info size issues. (Tim)
26.12.2010:
        - Initial addition of midi track info to pianoroll. WORK IN PROGRESS. (Tim)
          TODO: Just to get off the hard drive. A few things still need to be linked up!
                And we really need icons to replace those 'T' 'C' 'S' 'X' buttons.
        - Fix minor issues that surfaced when I built an RPM for the alpha release (Orcan):
              o Added missing AudioVideo category to the .desktop file.
              o Fixed the executable name in the .desktop file.
              o Converted README.softsynth, synti/vam/README, README.de, SECURITY to UTF8.
              o Made the default MusE_DOC_DIR consistent with other default definitions.
              o Removed explicit rpath to ${QT_LIBRARY_DIR}. cmake should add it automatically
                if there's need.
              o Removed unnecessary linkage to libQtSvg.
              o utils are installed with executable permissions.

        - Capitalizations in the menus thanks to Geoff King (gsking1->gmail. com)
        - Added some comments in app.cpp that I've been willing to include for a while. (Orcan)
        - Added a line to CMakeLists to install the splash image. Commented out for now. (Orcan)
        - added new-user help dialog for Input button on midi track-info (rj)
        - Fixed *some* gui drawing speed issues. (Tim)
          Use Qt::WA_OpaquePaintEvent for windows we fully draw on, like part canvas, track list, meter.
          In PartCanvas::drawItem(), ignore null intersect of item bbox + rect.
          TODO: Other windows like Slider and Knob could probably use this. And with many parts,
                 drawing is still slow (esp waves), possibly because of alpha blending. 
21.12.2010:
        - Moved all the config files "~/.musePrj, ~/.MusE, ~/.deicsonze.dco" into ~/.config/MusE/
          and renamed them as "projects, MusE.cfg, deicsonze.dco", respectively. (Orcan)
        - User instruments path is made user configurable with default location in
          ~/.config/MusE/instruments
        - In simpledrums2, set the 64bit ladpsa plugin paths. (Orcan)

        - Fixed arranger grid h-line drawing, track, and part drawing alignment, border issues. (Tim)
        - To open help pages, use the default browser of the system via QDeskopServices. Removed
          the configuration option to select the browser. (Orcan)
        - Added some groupboxes and layouts to Global Settings to make it look more uniform. (Orcan)
        - Don't pack the binary and subversion directories when doing "make package_source". (Orcan)
        - Updated the Russian translation again thanks to Alex, alex54m -> mail.ru
        - Fix a typo in awl/CMakeLists.txt that disabled the translations for awl. (Orcan)
        - Updated all the .ts files with the latest strings. Made sure that share/locale/CMakeLists
          is scanned last so that all the translations are collected before coming to that. (Orcan)
        - Fix: cliplist target should depend on widgets target. (Orcan)
19.12.2010:
        - Fixed not saving part colours and part canvas background appearance settings. (Tim)
        *Feature: Added 'global opaqueness' (transparency) appearance setting. (Tim)
          Currently only affects part colours. 
          TODO: Fix the darn black rectangle drawing. Apply the opaqueness to some other things.
        - Fixed arranger part drawing borders. Used QPen::setCosmetic(true) when drawing. (Tim)

          Unified their notation. Added copyright notices to those which were missing. 
        - Defined MusE_SHARE_DIR and MusE_LIB_DIR in config.h.in so that these directories 
          can be accessed conveniently in the code. (Orcan)
        - Install documentation files to the standard docdir specified by FHS. (Orcan)
18.12.2010:
        - Fixed transport shortcuts not working in some windows or situations. (Tim)
          Added event->ignore to PartCanvas::keyPress. Added setFocusPolicy() to WaveView, Master.
          Added (canvas or view)->setFocus() to WaveEdit, MasterEdit. Test OK.
        - Fixed rack drag'n drop. Added individual tooltips for effects since the astrip might
          be too narrow. (Orcan)
17.12.2010:
        - Fixed crash with song loaded then File->New. Marker view had non-existent items from cleared marker list. (Tim)
        - Some memory leak cleanups. Delete midiInstruments and midiDevices. (Tim)
          TODO: Many more leaks to fix. 
16.12.2010:
        - Fixed track list track moving/resizing - added ev->buttons() check to mouseMoveEvent(). (Tim)
        - Fixed meter drawing (speed) - removed double buffer pixmap. Test OK. (Tim)
15.12.2010:
        - Major cleanup in the #includes. Emptied all.ha nnd moved its contents to individual files.
          The build is roughly 20% faster now. (Orcan)
        - Fixed track list drawing - removed double buffer pixmap. Test OK. (Tim)  
14.12.2010:
        - Fixed corruption on track info instrument patch button due to latin1() conversions. (Tim)
          Changed MidiInstrument::getPatchName() and EditInstrument::getPatchName() to return QString.
13.12.2010:
        - List the available locales in the --help output. (Orcan)
        - Fixed audio/midi control right-click automation popups were greyed out due to typo. (Tim)
        - Fixed some QMenu usages without parent and/or delete. (Tim)
        - DeicsOnze: Fixed: Crash in ctor, _preset not init. by time loadConfiguration called. Re-arranged. 
          And 3 popup QMenu usages without delete. Test OK. (Tim)
        - Deicsonze: Fixed all missing icons throughout. Added qrc file, changed ui file. Looks nice now. (Tim) 
12.12.2010:
        - Integrated the translation system into cmake. Added a -DUPDATE_TRANSLATIONS flag to cmake
          which will update the .ts files in the source tree with the newest strings. I used this to
          update the existing translations. Also I removed the .qm files from the SVN, as they will
          be now installed from the build tree. (Orcan)
        - Added a -l flag to the muse executable to override the locale detection, mostly for testing
          purposes. (Orcan)
        - Updated the Russian translation thanks to Alex, alex54m -> mail.ru
        - When updating the .ts files, by adding proper dependencies, make sure all targets are 
          scanned. Otherwise .ts files may miss some strings. (Orcan)
11.12.2010:
      * Feature: Added default midi track in/out channels to midi ports list. (Tim)
        - For now, the boxes use the old text channel strings ("1 3 5", "1-5", "all, "none" etc.)
      * Changed: Experimental: Mid ports now default to 'GM' instrument. (Tim)
        - Was stopping new users from seeing instrument patches etc.
        - TODO: Overhaul instrument type, instrument sysexes, and song type.
      * Changed: Audio groups and inputs no longer default connect to first audio out. (Tim)
        - Find it tedious, once a song grows with groups and inputs, to keep disconnecting them from output.
        - TODO: Add a better audio default routing system.
10.12.2010:
        - More compiler and build warnings fixes. (Orcan)

        - Fixed ctrl canvas not lining up in drumedit and pianoroll. (Orcan)
        - Fix: Save project file dialog should have a "Save" button instead of "Open". (Orcan)
        - Fix: Crash when Ok is clicked in the plugin selection dialog with no plugins
          selected. Well, I fixed the crash, then I also disabled the Ok button until
          a plugin is selected. (Orcan)
        - Feature: Middle mouse button click on a plugin in the rack will (un)byass the 
          plugin. (Orcan)
        - Actually, use Qt:MidButton instead of instead of Qt:MiddleButton in rack.cpp.
          The latter is Qt >= 4.7 only.
09.12.2010:
        - Fix: column orders mess up in the main window, and they do not save properly in
          the .med files. (Orcan)
        - Made MusE the owner of transport object so it's now deleted when MusE object is deleted. (Tim)
        - Improved PosEdit class, supports undo/redo levels, focus-out + return pressed updating. (Tim)
          This also fixes the Transport position boxes' sections jumping to last section. 
          TODO: There's still trouble editing with KB in Bar-Beat-Tick mode, the bar and beat being '1' based.
          TODO: Fix SigEdit (the time Signature Editor boxes).
        - Fix some build and compiler warnings. (Orcan)
        - Fix the max slider value in the transport. This was a typo I made during conversion. (Orcan)
08.12.2010:
        - Ported many more Qt3 methods to Qt4. (Orcan)
        - Turned off Qt3Support. Muse2 is now a pure Qt4 application. (Orcan)
07.12.2010:
        - Ported rack. TODO: Drag and drop needs a hand. It's not working. (Orcan)
        - Converted various Qt3 support methods to Qt4 in many files. (Orcan)
        - Includes cleanup in app.*. (Orcan)
        - Converted all instances of latin1() and crossed my fingers. Initial tests OK. (Orcan)
06.12.2010
        - Built Awl::posedit and Awl::sigedit, and replaced /widget versions and all usages. (Tim)
          TODO: Awl::sigedit has no returnPressed signal, for lmaster. 
          TODO: Transport position posedits jump to sub-ticks sections - can't auto-inc other sections.
        - Reverted class SpinBox to previous revision. Test OK. (Tim)
05.12.2010
        - Completed porting of dlist module (the drum list). Test OK. (Tim)
        - Ported sigedit and posedit. Used SpinBox in place of Q3SpinWidget. TODO: Needs some work on
          locating the arrows of the SpinBox accurately. Maybe we need to implement another SpinBox
          from scratch? (Orcan)
        - Ported plugin.cpp. Both internal and LADSPA plugins tested okay. (Orcan)
        - Trivial conversion of Qt3 support methods to Qt4 in some widgets: slider, sliderbase, knob,
          ttoolbutton, mlabel. (Orcan)
04.12.2010
        - Fix: Escape button does not exit track renaming editor. (Orcan)
        - Fix: Midi ports config table items are editable when they are not supposed to. (Orcan)
        - Ported scldiv. Things seem to work as before. Maybe needs more testing. (Orcan)
        - Removed fontsel, and synthwizardbase from the project. (Orcan)
        - Feature: In waveedit, the mousewheel controls the vertical slider. (Orcan)
        - Completed porting shortcutcapturedialog, filedialog. Added paste clone, 2track, clone2track, 
           insert empty, insert, to configurable shortcuts. Changed all arr/pianoroll/drumedit hard-wired 
           keys to refer to shortcut table. (TODO: Other windows?) (Tim)
        - Correction: Convert all state() to QInputEvent::modifiers() and stateAfter() to modifiers()
           (I forced a downcast to QInputEvent if required). Is correct? QT Help says:
           QInputEvent::modifiers() "Returns the keyb. mod. flags that existed imm. before the event occurred."
           QKeyEvent::modifiers()   "Returns the keyb. mod. flags that existed imm. after the event occurred."           
03.12.2010
        - Ported all copy/paste/drag/drop coding. Including pianoroll, drumedit, pcanvas, prcanvas, dcanvas, 
           and effect rack. Test OK cut, copy, paste, also drag n drop various files to arranger and rack. (Tim)
        - Fixed arranger menu cut/copy enabling. Was never right before. Test OK cut and copy. (Tim)
        - Completed port of MidiInstrument. Fixed its populatePatchPopup(), which fixes midi trackinfo 
           instrument selection not updating h-bank, l-bank, and prog spinboxes. (Tim)
        - Some cleanups: Remove the old Header class. Rename HeaderNew to Header. (Orcan)
        - Ported: osc, wave, dcanvas. (Orcan)
02.12.2010
        - Ported alayout, tlist, arranger (Orcan)
        - Minor tweak in the HeaderNew API to set column widths easier. Also commented out the
          old Header class. We can probably remove it soon. (Orcan)
        - Ported help.cpp as is. But maybe we should use QDesktopServices to open user's default browser
          instead of the browser specified in a config option. (Orcan)
        - Ported scrollscale and splitter (Orcan)
01.12.2010
        - Ported listedit. (Orcan)
        - I missed to port one action call in drumedit. Now it's (hopefully) done. (Orcan)

30.11.2010
        - Ported vscale and ctrledit. (Orcan)
29.11.2010
        - In Mess::processEvent(), added ME_PITCHBEND case. For synths which don't override 
           processEvent (like Vam and Deicsonze). Pitchbend should work in them now. (Tim)
        - Added a new HeaderNew (Qt4 based) class to be used instead of Header (Qt3 based). (Orcan)
        - Ported drumedit except a Q3PopupMenu reference that needs to be ported in midiport.cpp.
          This update restores the tooltips, adds icons to edit menu items in drumedit window. (Orcan)
28.11.2010
        - Finished porting Marker View. (Orcan)
        - Ported ctrlpanel. Needs some testing. I also removed usage of the Oxygen's "pen" icon
          in place of the pencil. The pen looks bad in ctrlpanel. (Orcan)
        - Deicsonze2 added (!!) Fresh re-import from evolution. Test OK. (Tim)
          TODO: Plugin controllers disabled - we need the Ctrl class. 
                Restoring of state (that's a MusE problem I think).   
                Fix deicsonze.cpp:3612: warning: deprecated conversion from string constant to ‘char*’
        - Ported Mastertrack list view. (Orcan)
        - Finished porting of Canvas module. Should be done. Not sure about one mouse event buttons() usage. (Tim)
27.11.2010
        - Completed porting pianoroll module including menus, shortcuts. Should be done. (Tim)
        - Ported the following .ui widgets to Qt4: organguibase, gatetime, midisync,

        - Ported Quant Config dialog. (Orcan)
        - Ported the popup menus in the canvas. This should restore the color selection of tracks. (Orcan)
        - Removed midiportroutebase.ui, fdialogbase.ui (the one from organ) (Orcan)
        - Removed some unnecessary Q3* references. Converted popup menus in various places. (Orcan)
26.11.2010
        - Fixed midi trackinfo growing size - set output device list box and instrument button 
           h-size policy to 'Ignore'. (Tim)
        - Fixed trackinfo spinboxes only go to 99 - changed some trackinfo ui spinbox properties
           (maxValue -> maximum, minValue -> minimum etc). (Tim)
        - Fixed SpinBoxFP class. Was never right before. (Tim)
        - Fixed transform and input transform ui files and dialogs - using the corrected SpinBoxFP. (Tim)   
        - Converted comboQuant widget to Qt4 (found in miditransform dialog). 
          TODO: Doesn't actually open - why? (Tim)
        - Finished porting edit instrument dialog to Qt4. listitem.h is removed as it is no longer
          needed. (Orcan)
        - Added missing includes on comboQuant. The compilation was failing here. (Orcan)
25.11.2010
        - Fixed column widths, alignments, device renaming and jack device creation issues in synthconfigbase.
          Somehow the last changelog entry about this didn't get committed. That's added too. (Orcan)
24.11.2010
        - Resinstated the Midi Transformer. Was left out when both TF and iTF were removed, and then I 
           asked for them to be put back. So yes, transformbase.ui is used now. (Tim)
        - Completed conversion of waveedit(.cpp, h), including menus and shortcuts. Should be done. (Tim)
        - Set undo/redo shortcuts on global undoAction/redoAction, instead of Q3Accel in each window. (Tim)
        - Fixed some leftover setAccel()'s in app.cpp (Tim) 
        - Fixed delete shortcut key. Set in MusE constructor. (Tim)
        - Reinstated special Toplevel::CLIPLIST case in MusE::toplevelDeleted(). Caused problems. (Tim)
          TODO: Still not right with the menu checkmark...
        - Ported rhythmbase, fluidsynthgui, fluidgui to Qt4 (Orcan)
        - Removed patchbaybase from the project (Orcan)

        - Fixed a connection in miditransform (Orcan)
        - Fixed crash in FluidSynthGui::channelItemClicked(): Use item->row() for the channel. Test OK. (Tim)
        - Start porting synthconfigbase. It's mostly functional. TODO: Column widths and alignments,
          renaming device name, port Q3WhatsThis bits (Orcan)
23.11.2010
        - Added Track::cname(), applied to strip labels' object names, so they may be used in style sheets. (Tim)
        - Added struct SysEx and some friends, to minstrument.h, prep. for the instrument editor. (Tim)
22.11.2010
        - Oops, fixed regression, marker view and cliplist crashes, removed setAttribute(Qt::WA_DeleteOnClose) 
           from TopWin constructor, and added it to individual TopWin sub-classes (only MidiEditor needs it). (Tim)
        - Final major leak fixed: We can now delete the main MusE object just before returning from main! (Tim)
          Now that markerview, cliplist et. al. are also being deleted (verified, dtors called), I changed 
           MusE::startClipList() so the main MusE instance owns it like all the others. It deletes too, now. 
          Also removed odd special Toplevel::CLIPLIST case in MusE::toplevelDeleted(). Hope it works... 
          Tested closing complex song, with all windows open. Nice to see final Finished! message (new, with -D).
        - Eliminated double-buffer pixmap in View class (not required in Qt4). TODO: install event handler. (Tim) 
        - Ported the following .ui widgets to Qt4: editgainbase, gensetbase (Orcan)
        - Removed unused .ui widgets: wtrackinfo.ui, editctrl7dialogbase.ui, editmetadialogbase.ui (Orcan)
        - Fixed remaining alignment issues in editors, using setSpacing(0). TODO Controller panels. (Tim) 
21.11.2010
        - All menus now use QActions. Some shortcuts are left to be assigned correctly (Orcan)
        - Clean up: Remove submenu integer ids from the MusE class in favor of QActions (Orcan)
        - Ported the following .ui widgets to Qt4: didyouknow, transposebase, cliplist,
          configmidifilebase (Orcan)
        - Ported View and MidiEditor classes. Fixed TopWin constructor. Test OK all editors. (Tim) 
20.11.2010
        - Remove most wrapper classes around .ui widgets. I was wrapping them too much. Some widgets
          (e.g. songinfo) still need wrappers though. (Orcan)
        - Ported the following .ui widgets to Qt4: appearancebase, mixdowndialogbase, 
          shortcutcapturedialogbase, shortcutconfigbase, aboutbox, editsysexdialogbase,
          editnotedialogbase, editctrlbase (Orcan)
        - Converted all of editevent.cpp to Qt4 (Orcan)

19.11.2010
        - Started some conversions of midieditor, pianoroll, drumedit, incl. their QGridLayouts. (Tim)
        - More icon conversion work (Orcan)
        - Move global, user, project .xpm files into the xpm/ directory. Handle them the same way in 
          filedialog.cpp as we handle other pixmaps elsewhere. (Orcan)
        - Ported the following .ui widgets to Qt4: commentbase, metronomebase, mtrackinfobase, 
          midifilter (Orcan)
18.11.2010
        - Updated build part README file - read it! Tell user to specify Release build type. (Tim)
        - Added printout of build type in top level cmake. (Tim)
        - Removed duplicate LASH detection in top level cmake. (Tim)
        - Ported the following .ui widgets to Qt4: transformbase, itransformbase, mrconfigbase (Orcan)
        - Finished remaining port work of mixer and strips. Should be all done now. (Tim)
	- Modified icons.cpp to Use theme icons whenever possible. We now need to match muse
	  icons with the standard theme icon names (Orcan)
17.11.2010
        - Removed a fix which cured graphic corruption for me in MusE-1. Not required now. (Tim)
        - Small change to Orcan's filedialog, re-enabled global button. (Tim)
        - Ported the following .ui widgets to Qt4: songinfo, mittransposebase, velocitybase (Orcan)
16.11.2010
        - Fixed track info sizing problems. In Arranger::switchInfo() added tgrid->update(). (Tim)
          QLayout::update() seems to be a new method, we needed to call it here.
        - Fixed mixer maximum and minimum sizes. (Tim)
          Bit of a tough hack. Is there a better way? Done by sub-classing QScrollArea and catching 
           LayoutRequest events, just before paint events when the window sizes are finally correct.
          TODO: Still off by a few pixels when mixer first opened, because main window frameSize 
           is not set yet, by the time LayoutRequest is caught.
	- Transformed file dialogs to Qt4. This was the first attempt to transform a .ui file to Qt4
	  as well. New .ui files do not store image information. Thus I moved the 3 icons from
	  qfiledialog.ui into their own files.
	  TODO: Qt4 does not support file preview in file dialogs yet. The relevant code (wallpaper
	  preview) is disabled. Now we either have to implement an image previewer, or forget about
	  this feature. (Orcan)
	- Only try to use theme icons in file dialogs if Qt >= 4.6 (Orcan)
14.11.2010
        - renamed deicsonze2 files and classes with '2' suffixes
        - Applied patch by Orcan to convert populateAddSynth(). (Tim)
        - Changed all setMargin() calls to setContentsMargins(). (setMargin() is obsoleted!) (Tim)
        - Fixed crash in MusE::closeEvent() upon close: save, skip, abort? = abort. (Tim)
          TODO: Some other suspicious looking closeEvent()s. May need to fix...
12.11.2010
        - Fixed arranger alignment issues - set layout margins to zero. (Tim)
          TODO: Track list items aligned to canvas tracks are still off by one lousy vertical pixel.
11.11.2010
        - WIP: Mixer and strips re-designed to be theme/font friendly - no more fixed STRIP_WIDTH. (Tim)
        - Fixed Slider, Knob and DoubleEntry classes. Knob anti-aliasing applied (where allowed).
        - Transport handle colour fixed - added setAutoFillBackground(true). 
10.11.2010
        - Ported transport window to Qt4. The handle color needs a fix (Orcan) 
09.11.2010
        - Fixed audio and midi strips and converted to Qt4. Looks OK now, but will be better... (Tim)
          TODO: Convert Slider, Knob, EffectRack, ComboBox classes etc. (After that the strips will be perfect.)
08.11.2010
	- Add missing link to libdl.so. Caused build failure on Fedora 14 (Orcan)
        - Fixed strip name label colours, also name label auto-font-sizing. (Tim) 
        - Updated some window flags (stay on top, delete on close...) (Tim)
07.11.2010
        - Mixer is fixed and converted to QT4. (Tim)
        - Conversion of TLLayout class to QT4. 
        - Conversion of TempoEdit class to QT4. Displays proper doubles now.
06.11.2010
        - Yipee! De retour aux les popup menus 'stay-open'. (Tim)
        - Fixed PopupMenu class. All routing popups done (midi trackinfo, midi strip, audio strip).
          TODO: Fix midi 'toggle all'. Use routes as QVariant action user data (someone started this already)...
        - Major cleanup of audio and midi strip comments, code. (A fresh start for your tired eyes, you guys...)
        - Test OK so far with all track types. 
04.11.2010
        - Fixed LADSPA plugin dialog. TODO: fix sorting order. (Tim)
        - Fixed MenuTitleItem class. Fixed some usages of it (Jack popup routes, midi cfg routes). (Tim) 
02.11.2010
        - Solved! All the MESS synths load now. Removed mpevent(.h, .cpp) and evdata.h from /libsynti, 
           conflicting with copies in /muse, causing crashes. Versions in /muse are newer. 
          Should only be one version. Whether we end up putting it in a library, or leaving it 
           in the main app as I have done here, it had to be moved one way or another. 
          If we really need 'reduced, simplified' functionality of the /libsynti mpevent versions,
           then it should be a base/inherited class type of solution, not two different copies. (Tim)
02.11.2010
        - Fluid, fluidsynth, simpledrums: Testing: For now, disable certain sendSysex() calls crashing. (Tim)
          Marked as "MusE FIXME:". At least fluidsynth appears to be working now. Other two not so good.
01.11.2010
        - Fixed all MESS plugins: compile with -fvisibility=hidden, to avoid namespace conflicts.
          In particular, simplesynth was causing conflict with variable 'plugins' causing it to 
           be overwritten. 
        - So, this fixes LADSPA plugins not appearing in plugin list.
        - Added simpledrums from muse_qt4_evolution, is called 'simpledrums2' and replaces the original.
31.10.2010
        - Fixed Toolbar1 class. 'Snap', 'Quantize' combo boxes should work now. Thanks to Luis G. for help. (Tim)
30.10.2010
        - Fixed Deicsonze crash and missing Organ. Both load now. (Tim.)
27.10.2010
        - Fixed drawing of Slider widget and Meter widget (rj)
        - Fixed keyboard shortcuts for tools on toolbar (rj)
        - More conversions with windows done previously done, fixes. Marker, Master gui + List. (Tim)
          Some new style header fixes here/there. 
26.10.2010  
        - Fixed non-opening view menu windows (mixers, marker, bigtime etc). (Tim)
          Found all the isItemChecked() returning opposite of before (for example in toggleBigTime()). 
          And yet the setItemChecked() remains unmodified and it works (for example in showBigtime()).
          Not understood why - yet.
26.10.2010  
        - Applied large patch by Orcan to (start) converting to native QMainWindow and QToolBar. (Tim)
        - Completed piano roll, drum edit, MusE app, and arranger toolbars.
24.10.2010  
        - Finds MESS synths now including fluid/fluidsynth, but all crash except Vam and S1. (Tim.)
22.10.2010  
        - cmake scripts changes thanks to Orcan Ogetbil oget.fedora > gmail.com (Tim.)
          'make uninstall' facility added! 
          Drop our obsolete pkgconfig for newer native cmake pkgconfig.
          LASH detection fixed.
          Summary added.
          Renamed installed executable 'muse' to 'muse2'.
          Install /utils, /packaging, and /demos files.
          Other minor changes.
21.10.2010  
        - Toolbar1 usage of Q3ListBox changed to QTableWidget. (p4.0.3 Tim)
        - More Toolbar1 fixes. (p4.0.4 Tim)
        - Fixed widgets/tools.cpp EditToolBar::EditToolBar connect Q3Action. (p4.0.5 Tim)
        - Crashes: Removed all "undoRedo->removeFrom..." from destructors (~pianoroll() ~drumedit() etc.) (p4.0.6 Tim)
20.10.2010
      * Fixed: cmake should work now. (T356)
        - Changed the QT4_WRAP_UI3 macro to generate  <filename>.h  instead of  ui_<filename>.h
        - In /muse/CMakeLists.txt, included all the uic generated headers paths (the 'build' paths). 
        - Tested OK with fresh svn pull.
19.10.2010
      * Fixed: Some missing files, errors with cmake build. (T356)
19.10.2010
      * Changed: Build system changed to cmake. (T356)
        - Some other suitable changes. p4.0.2
        - WIP Need to fix a few placed in code with regards to installation search paths (MESS synths not found etc.)
        - Choose suitable version number. Currently left at 2.0.1 
        - Maybe a few other things. Change name of prog so as not to conflict with existing muse installation? etc. etc.
        - Default install location is /usr/local. Be careful not to overwrite an existing working muse-1 !
16.10.2010
      * Fixed: Routing and popup menus should work now. Sorry, no 'stay-open' menus for now. (T356)
        - p4.0.1 Reverted back to regular non-overloaded Q3PopupMenu behaviour (self-extinguishing) for PopupMenu class.
        - Removed "gRoutingMenuMap.clear()" and "gRoutingPopupMenuMaster = 0" from MusE::routingPopupMenuAboutToHide().
          Instead, added protection from non-visible menu in MusE::updateRouteMenus().
      * Tested: Pianoroll, drums open but toolbars are very messed up. Marker, transport, bigtime, all others seem OK.    
15.10.2010
      * Feature: Unified Jack midi devices in midi ports list. Can be both input and output, just like ALSA devices. (T356)
        - Marked as p3.3.55 
      * Corrected: Three things which did not compile in conversion to new muse-2: (T356) 
        - <string>true</string> -> <bool>true</bool> in mtrackinfobase.ui, for recEchoButton toggleButton property. (T356)
        - Surround with QString(): "strerror(errno)" in MusE::save(), and "incstr" in MidiDeviceList::add(). (T356)
14.10.2010
      =======================================
      * muse2 branch (Conversion to QT4, QT3 compatibility mode for now) checked in (rj) (T356)
      =======================================

09.10.2010
      * Fixed: Gluing of midi track parts, over tempo changes, caused incorrect note times and lengths. (T356)
        - Fixed Song::cmdGluePart().
08.10.2010
      * Disabled: Precount does not work, disabled function in gui (rj)
      =======================================
      * 1.1 tagged (rj)
      =======================================
      * added: missing headerfile in dssihost.cpp, required for building on Ubuntu Maverick (rj)
21.09.2010
      * Fixed: Mixers not restoring their size properly upon song load. (T356)
        - Rearranged MusE::loadProjectFile1() slightly so mixer resizing done at end. Tested OK.
      * Changed: Disabled some optimized code always enabled in Dsp::cpy(), for now, in case of 64-bit issues. (T356) 
16.09.2010
      * Created rc2 release for 1.1 (rj)
      * Fixed: Delete track(s) not disconnecting track routes, causing routes to hang around and store in song file. (T356)
        - Fixed major regressions (my fault) in Song::insertTrack2() and ::removeTrack2().
      * Fixed: Dummy audio device: Crashes when Jack midi device created in device manager, or loaded from song. (T356)
        - This allows to create Jack midi devices even when dummy audio driver is used.
        - Tested OK loading complex Jack midi based songs with dummy audio driver.
      * Fixed: AlsaTimer cannot start, with dummy audio device. (T356) 
        - Reverted: Back to default SND_TIMER_GLOBAL_SYSTEM in AlsaTimer, for now until a better fix. 
        - Also replaced pop-up warning in dummy loop with terminal output instead.
      * Changed: MidiDevice <-> Track routes replaced with MidiPort <-> Track routes. (T356)
        - This allows to change a port's device (even to <none> !) while keeping all the track channel routes.
      * Changed: Single midi <-> track route with channel mask, instead of one route-per-channel. (T356)
        - Potentially saving very many routes from memory and in song file.
10.09.2010
      * Fixed: regression with oR routing for Aux strips (rj)
05.09.2010
      * Fixed: shortcut for insert moved to Ctrl+Shift+X (rj)
      * Added: Select all toggle for midi channels iR menu (rj)
      * Added: Auto-route-connect old songs with obsolete midi input port/channel masks (before iR button added). (T356) 
        - Added MidiTrack::setInPortAndChannelMask() and called it from MidiTrack::read().
03.09.2010
      * Changed: Updated German localizations muse_de.qm and muse_de.ts from <babarosa [at] gmx.at> (T356)
      * Added: Instrument definitions and drum maps for Kurzweil SP2X, from <babarosa [at] gmx.at> (T356)
28.08.2010
      * Created rc1 release for 1.1 (rj)
      * Added: Instrument definitions for AKAI SG01 and Waldorf-microQ from <babarosa [at] gmx.at> (rj)
23.08.2010
      * Added: Possibility to turn on/off move-armed-track with track selection in settings (rj)
21.08.2010
      * Renamed: Soft synth configuration changed to Synth configuration, as per patch from Geoff King (rj)
      * Fixed: Shortcuts with modifier keys wasn't working for global shortcuts, should be now (rj)
      * Added: Shortcuts for changing len of events, default Ctrl+Shift+Left/Right (rj)
10.08.2010
      * Fixed/Changed: Grid reacts to midi resolution change (rj)
01.08.2010
      * Added: Move track selection when part selection is moved, is this a good approach? (rj)
      * Added: Backspace unarms all armed tracks (rj)
24.07.2010
      * Feature: Audio and midi routing popup menus now stay open, for making rapid connections. (T356)
      * Fixed: Delete some objects hanging around upon close like song, audio, midiSeq, and prefetch. (T356)
               TODO: Find a way to delete the 'muse' object without causing problems like seg faults.
21.07.2010
      * Improved: Note lanes in pianoroll and marking of C-notes (rj)
20.07.2010
      * Fixed: illegal shortcut no longer reported on startup (rj)
18.07.2010
      * Fixed: Handle errors during timer initialization more gracefully (rj)
15.07.2010
      * Added: Volume control for audio metronome (rj)
12.07.2010
      * Fixed: When wave files were edited allocation was on stack which caused crashes for larger selections, now done on heap (rj)
      * Added: Print svn version in -v and About box. (rj)
      * Fixed: Bug with RemoveShortEvents plugin script, would not remove anything due to index error (rj)
10.07.2010
      * Added: Insert measure, inserts empty space and moves everything after playpointer to the right and
               Part-insert, pastes parts and moves everything after the paste point to the right
               it's currently not possible to change the shortcuts for these, wip (rj)
06.07.2010
      * Added: Button in transport to enable/disable jack transport. (rj)
      * Fixed: Dropdown Snap and Type in arranger toolbar no longer steal focus, annoyed the helloutame (rj)
      * Fixed: Making edits to larger chunks in wave files no longer cause a crash, heap is used for allocation (rj)
      * Improved: Part selection when navigating with keyboard, previously there was sometimes a need to use the mouse
        to get a part selected, now the first one should be selected (rj)
      * Added: some automation (very)wip stuff, not enabled, just to get it off my harddrive (rj)
22.06.2010
      * Fixed: Crashes loading a song while another is loaded. Or worse, it loads but saving corrupts the file! (T356)
        - Song::clear(): Clear all midi port devices. Delete Jack midi devices, and remove all ALSA midi device routes.
        - Route::read() Ignore bogus midi routes in med file if the device they refer to is not in use by the song (port is -1).
        - MidiJackDevice::writeRouting(), MidiAlsaDevice::writeRouting(): Ignore and do not write midi routes if the device 
           they refer to is not in use by the song (port is -1). This prevents bogus midi routes writing to med file.
        - Fifo::~Fifo(): Free the buffers! Fifo::getWriteBuffer(), Fifo::put(): Verify allocation. Fifo::get(): Verify buffers.
15.06.2010
      * Fixed: Jack midi output: Sent pitch bend and program values were incorrect, if coming from midi keyboard. (T356)
        - Reported by Pieter while using Hurdy Gurdy vst under fst. Tests OK now, here.
      * Fixed: Drum editor: Controller graph not in current tool mode (pencil, eraser etc.), when first opened. (T356)
        - Call setTool() in DrumEdit::addCtrl().
      * Fixing: Drum editor: Velocity controller graph showing incorrect for selected drum, or showing for all drums, when first opened. (T356) 
        - WIP. Still not quite correct, but at least now it doesn't show all drum velocities when first opened. 
          (This is interesting! I will try to allow 'no drum' list selection, to show all drum velocities at once, just like piano roll.)
13.06.2010
      * Fixed: More fixes to marker list, selected item was still not right. (T356)
03.06.2010
      * Fixed: Time signature editing problems in master track list and gui. (T356)
        - Fixed SigEdit::outOfRange(). Added Sig::isValid(), and check it in LMaster::returnPressed() to fix crash with 0 n or z.
      * Fixed: Marker/list problems. Double entries. Pianoroll/arranger timescale 'shift-left/right-click-to-add/del-marker' fixed. 
               Marker 'lock' (smpte/ticks) works now. Up/down buttons fixed. Marker list selection 'stays put' now 
                when adding or deleting markers. (T356)
      * Fixed: Graphics corruption in arranger and track list when vertically scrolling. (T356)
        - Changed rectangle to full w/h in 'shift down' section of View::setYPos() and TList::setYPos().
          Should not have to do this, but it cured my problems. No noticeable change in speed.
        - Arranger corruption occurred on more than one machine with xorg nv, ati drivers. More severe arranger AND track list 
           corruption occurred with proprietary drivers. Corruption is also observed in several other windows (ex. ladspa browser) 
           but there's not much I can do, the corruption is found in ordinary usage of QListView for example.
      * Changed: Increased arranger vertical scroll step, was too slow to scroll. (T356)
      * Possible fix: Auto-scroll in pianoroll and arranger take waaay too long to stop scrolling. (T356)
        - Increased timer timeout from 40 to 80 ms in Canvas::scrollTimerDone(). Helped for me, on a 1.6Ghz P4...
      * Changed: Ladspa plugin guis now have scroll bars. Helps when there are many controls. (T356)
        - Still toying with the code a bit, please bear with me while I try to get it right.
      * Started: Addition of MusE-native ladspa guis for dssi synths. (T356)
        - No visible changes yet, just under the hood. Added class PluginIBase which is inherited by
           DssiSynthIF and PluginI. Changed class PluginGui and DssiSynthIF to fit. 
07.05.2010
      * Fixed: Xml file trouble: Tag attributes not storing xml-friendly entities, trouble reloading song. (T356)
        - Fixed all usages of Xml::nput, ::put, ::tag, and ::etag. Discovered by Geoff B.
06.05.2010
      * Fixed: Audio Input tracks: Loud noises or DC output with unconnected input routes. (T356)
        - AudioInput::getData(): Do not get buffers of unconnected client ports. Causes repeating leftover data.
      * Fixed: Audio Input tracks: Stereo processing not correct if both input routes connected to same port. (T356)
        - AudioInput::getData(): Just copy the buffers always, don't set buffer pointer directly.
      * Fixed: Effect rack plugins: Not saving correct number of plugin channels. Upon reload, channels are wrong. (T356)
        - PluginI::writeConfiguration() and PluginI::readConfiguration(): Write and read the channels, not instances.
        - Optimize TODO: Is xml plugin 'channel' really necessary? Well not now, but later if we optimize the effect rack
           by not creating redundant plugin instances if the next plugin in the rack doesn't need them.
          What I have changed is always make the number of plugin channels equal to the number of track channels.  
          PluginI::setChannels() and PluginI::initPluginInstance() then sort out the details of how many instances to create.
      * Fixed: Effect rack plugins: Some plugins crash MusE, for example plugins with no audio outputs. (T356)
        - PluginI::setChannels() and PluginI::initPluginInstance(): Be more aware of different audio ins and outs. 
      * Added: First draft help file README.effects-rack titled "Understanding the Effects Rack". (T356)
        - Details how MusE uses plugins, especially now with these changes.
27.04.2010
      * Changed: Building: Separate --enable-dssi --enable-osc configure options. (T356) 
        --enable-dssi (Enable dssi synths AND special handling of dssi-vst ladspa effect plugins. No guis if by itself.) and 
        --enable-osc (Enable dssi guis. Useless by itself at the moment). 
        Use both for best features. 
      * Feature: If dssi and osc support are enabled, audio track effects rack dssi-vst plugins can now show their NATIVE guis. (T356)
      * Fixed: Storing dssi synth states. Remembers current program, all configure strings, and control settings - for current program ONLY. (T356)
        - With dssi-vst synths, some better are than others at remembering program.
        - Todo: Ignore unwanted dssi-vst config strings/values like "guiVisible" "<name-of-fifo-file>" (gives non-fatal error on reload).
      * Fixed: Dssi native synths (hexter, LTS etc.) should actually work now. Their gui controls operate the sounds now. (T356) 
        - Todo: If using large audio buffers (Jack), my 'one-at-a-time-per-audio-process' osc control fifo streams kinda suck, 
           with a delay in their processing. Want to try MULTIPLE 'run's or 'run-multiple's PER audio process, for SAMPLE accuracy and
           better quicker message processing. Just need to add a timestamp to my osc fifo items, then all forms of change - whether
           control, midi event, or program - have a timestamp with which we can SPLIT UP the runs into 'runs between changes'.
      * Tip: Currently a patch to dssi-vst is required for their guis to update properly. (For now, ask about this on our lists.)
21.04.2010
      * Fixed: Shortcut for moving between tracks in arranger. Ctrl+Up/Down (rj)
19.04.2010
      * Patch: Fix for libdir bug causing synths to not be available on some 64bit systems. By Orcan Ogetbil (rj)
      * Fixed: Drawing of grid when snapping to less than measure (rj)
12.04.2010
      * Fixed: LADSPA rack effects: Do not display LADSPA output controls (such as latency). (T356)
      * Fixed: Bug when cancelling 'save as' operation, says 'file exists'. Caused by my earlier compressed save fixes. (T356)
11.04.2010
      * Fixed: DSSI requested midi mapped controls were not correct. (T356)
      * Changed: Working on controllers, and saving their state. Synths like Organ should remember their state now. (T356)
        - Working on DSSI controls... Working on OSC stuff...
06.04.2010
      * Fixed: Jack midi, and DSSI: Midi controller knobs, sliders, boxes etc. not updating with current values. (T356)
        - Copied code in MidiPort::sendEvent() to JackMidi::processMidi() and DssiSynthIF::getData().
      * Fixed: DSSI: Crashing with unknown controllers sent to synths. (T356)
        - Ignore unknown controllers in DssiSynthIF::processEvent(). 
05.04.2010
      * Added: Rec enabled track moved with selection when only one track is rec enabled (rj)
      * Changed: Made canvas show grid the default (rj)
      * Added: Jack midi ports can now be renamed in the ports list dialog, by clicking on the name. (T356)
        - Also cleaned up ports list behaviour and added tooltips.
30.03.2010
      * Major reworks: Jack midi, routing system, multichannel synth ins/outs, midi strips and trackinfo pane. (T356)
        - WORK IN PROGRESS. Should be usable for current projects.
        - ADVISORY: If opening current projects you are advised to "save as" or back up your med files (waves should be OK)
           until all is deemed to be working OK. It is possible more changes to .med file structure are needed later.
        - Some .med project file structures have CHANGED (like routing). I have tested opening large existing projects, 
           then re-saving them. OK so far.
          However, I have not added importing code for the old midi trackinfo panel 'input port' and 'input channel' boxes (gone now).
          If you want to wait, I am planning to do that, but later... Otherwise you must re-enter them with the new midi input routing.
        - ** Multichannel synth inputs and outputs: Fairly satisfied with popup menus, hopefully no major reworks... 
          Routing system fully supports multichannel synth mono/stero paths but is NOT COMPLETE yet. 
          When changing a connected track from stereo to mono, there is no coding yet to ensure the existing stereo routes are 
           changed from stereo to mono (just like the audio input and output tracks have always done with Jack routes).
          Also coding must be added to avoid simultaneous mono and stereo routes - make them mutually exclusive - although
           there's nothing technically wrong with it, it's just not desirable. 
        - ** Jack midi: You now create your own Jack midi ports. I have not added any means to delete them yet, but I believe
           if you 'unselect' them in the midi ports list so that they are not used, then the saved .med file will ignore them.
        - Multi-instances of MusE should work OK now - all ports should hopefully have unique names.    
        - Number of midi ports increased from 32 to 128. It's a bit much for the ports list, was planning "create your own
           midi port as needed" (like RG). Obstacles seem to have been cleared now, but it would be a big job (lots of places to change).
        - Along the way various tweaks and fixes when I spotted them.
18.02.2010
      * Added: Separate Jack midi client ports per MusE port. (T356)
        - For now, you will have to manually add further connections to those ports if desired, each session.
        - Tested OK rec/play so far.
      * Fixed: Some inconsistencies in midi controller number decoding. (T356)
        - Everything now references the values listed in midictrl.h
      * Fixed: Some Jack code was not calling free after calling certain functions. (T356)
      * Changed: Midi priority now deaults to audio priority +1. (T356)
        - Thanks to RJ for the convincing argument.
14.02.2010
      * Added: Jack midi input should be working now. Controllers, too. (T356)
        - Tested with large 1024 frame buffer. Events are recorded with good sub-tick (frame) resolution,
           as viewed in pianoroll with 64T snap grid. 
13.02.2010
      * Fixed: Jack midi output should now be frame-accurate, support variable length events (like sysex), 
                and most controllers should work. (T356)
        - TODO: No record yet. Just playback. 
        - TODO: I have code in place for multiple device listing (like ALSA) with auto-connect, 
           instead of single 'jackmidi' device, but it doesn't seem to want to actually connect. 
          Simply enable the #define JACK_MIDI_SHOW_MULTIPLE_DEVICES in driver/jackmidi.h 
           and it will magically switch. Shows port names as their alias #1 (with a rem'able line to 
           revert to non-alias names - to be made configurable later). I swear it was working, 
           then intermittent, then not at all. Hmm...
06.02.2010
      * Fixed: MusE hanging on close, with Jack driver. (T356)
        - Unregister Jack midi ports on destruction of JackAudioDevice.
05.02.2010
      * Fixed: Top level windows: Do not open if there are no parts. Case: bogus -1 top-level part index stored in med file. (T356)
        - Changed MusE::readToplevels() and stuff in listedit.cpp
        - Was causing crash of list editor upon loading a song saved with the list editor open. 
          Somehow a bogus -1 top-level part index can make it in to the .med file. Checking this...
      * Changed: Preparations for audio processors: Moved stuff out of class Event and into class WavePart. (T356)
        - WavePart needs a converter map to lookup events in the part's (shared) event list, in case clones exist !
          Ughh, it's going to be tough to ensure the map is always correct because an event cannot tell what part owns it...
04.02.2010
      * Improved: Grid handling in arranger improved, it should now be actually usable (rj)
01.02.2010
      * Fixed: Jack midi output: Stuck or missing notes. (T356)
        - Must only be one jack_midi_event_reserve() per event in handle_jack_midi_out_events().
31.01.2010
      * Changed: Midi sync window: Clock is now separated from other real time commands (play/stop etc). (T356)
31.01.2010
      * Fixed: Midi sync in: Should be very solid and 'in time' now, play/stop/continue. (T356)
        - Re-coded to begin incrementing immediately upon first-clock detection. Forbid MusE to send transport commands 
           while in external sync mode - our sync router handles that. Was causing problems. 
        - Tested OK: Ensoniq ESQ-1 KB (sends clocks ony between start and stop) and Roland TR-505 drums (clocks always running). 
          The measured general timings were quite different, but (thankfully) clocks and events were not. 
        - MusE responds better to the TR-505 than the ESQ-1 does with a direct midi cable connection! (ESQ gains ticks on continue).
      * Added: Midi sync window: 'Rewind on start' column. (Also a 'Send first clock delay' box - not implemented yet). (T356)
29.01.2010
      * Feature: Dummy audio driver: Added global settings for sample rate and period size. (T356)
        - The period size affects midi resolution, and the default was just too long. So this was added.
27.01.2010
      * Changed: Don't process audio prefetch, or getData() in Audio::copyData(), if track is 'Off'. (T356)
      * Added: Arranger track list: Quick 'right-click' or 'ctrl-click' or 'ctrl-mouse-wheel' toggling of Track On/Off. (T356) 
        - Note this includes midi tracks now! Remains to be seen whether allowing midi off is useful and will work, 
           or should be filtered out. **TODO: Turn off remaining controls in midi strips, turn off actual midi playback and record.
      * Feature: Initial Jack midi support. Imported from Larry Valkama's GIT repo. (T356)
26.01.2010
      * Fixed: Import midi 'replace' broken last fixes. (T356)
      * Fixed: External midi sync: Wait until first clock after start to start transport, and >= second clock to increment ticks. (T356)
24.01.2010
      * Added: Midi sync: Added 'Jack timebase master' checkbox, removed requirement of MusE being tempo map master. (T356)
      * Added: While on external sync and Jack timebase master, reports correct MusE BBT info to Jack. (Tempo not correct yet). (T356)
      * Added: Midi import option: Whether to split imported tracks into multiple parts. (T356)
23.01.2010
      * Fixed: External midi sync in: MusE transport not rewinding upon reception of start. (T356)
      * Added: Midi sync: MusE now transmits and receives some MMC commands, and displays some MTC and SMTPE info. (T356)
        - No transmit MTC or receive MTC syncing yet, just transport control stuff.
        - Tested OK with Rosegarden and Ardour, but they do not seem to have an option to sync to the input midi clock, 
           only MTC or internally. Must test when MTC output added to MusE. 
      * Improved: Midi sync editor window: Shows MMC and MTC activity and works with them now. (T356)
21.01.2010
      * Fixed: First tests: External midi sync in works now! Should be rock solid no matter what is thrown at it. (T356)
        - All changes are labeled "p3.3.25"
        - Switched to a 'direct drive' method instead of 'calculation of tempo' method.
          Drift between source of master and slave is non-existant since the incoming midi clocks 
           drive the midi engine directly. This is at the expense of exact 64th note resolution.
          At MusE's fixed 24 midi clocks per quarternote, triplet 32nd notes are resolved (32nd note divided by three).
          MusE's default 'division' (ticks per quarternote) is 384. 384/24 gives a division of 16 MusE 'ticks' per midi clock.
        - Normally when using the tempo map (external sync is off), device play event times are in frames,
           because the tempo map provides for that kind of sub-tick frame resolution.
          But now, during external sync, device play event times are in ticks, not frames. 
          Hence the compromise between exactness of note times, and master/slave drift.
        - Tested heavily with a Roland TR-505 which has a variable 'analog' tempo knob.  
          Combined that with a complete midi song, and other test 'tick' tracks driving external synth KB,
           was rock solid going 'absolutely nuts' with the tempo knob up to 260BPM, surprisingly good resolution.
        - TODO: Check safety of 'midiExtSyncTicks = 0' inside audio thread while midi thread is counting it up.
          Also fix seek operations and check for any more place needing these 'tick'frame' alterations.
      * Changed: Some more changes for compressed files operations. (T356)
        - More to be done, but tests OK so far.    
19.01.2010
      * Fixed: Saving/loading compressed .gz/.bz2 MusE .med files, + loading compressed .mid/.kar files (save broken, off for now). (T356)
        - Changed filedialog.cpp:getSaveFileName() and MusE::loadProjectFile1.
        - Added separate save file dialog filters in globals.cpp.
        - Disabled exporting of compressed midi/karaoke files (.mid/.kar) for now because
           a compressed file is opened as a pipe, and pipes can't seek, resulting in a 
           corrupted midi file in MidiFile::writeTrack(). 
18.01.2010
      * Added: Piano roll and drum editor edit menus: "Select prev/next part". With default hotkeys Alt+Left/Right. (T356) 
        - This is an easy way to switch parts when multiple part editing in one window (via Ctrl-E or Ctrl-D).
          And it was absolutely essential, for multiple dedicated controller track editing since there are no notes,
           and no (other) way to select another part to edit.
17.01.2010
      * Feature: MusE now has two mixers, with selectable track type display. (T356)
        - Changes to .med file were needed. Tested OK so far with old and new song files.
      * Fixed: Builtin freeverb and TAP reverb ladspa GUIs, or custom user GUIs not showing controls. (T356)
        - Broken since removal of musewidgetsplugin library months ago.
          Added PluginWidgetFactory class to handle local creation of controls.
          (Custom user GUIs must be done by hand since the removal of musewidgetsplugin library).
      * Fixed: Appearance settings red colour adjustment larger than others. (T356)
      * Changed: Default controller graph foreground colour from blue to medium orange. (T356)
        - Avoid clash with blue colour used by left and right markers.
12.01.2010
      * Release: 1.0.1 (rj)
10.01.2010
      * Fixed: python detection exchanged for script from http://libvirt.org/ (rj)
09.01.2010
      * Removed: Disabled watchdog thread. (T356)
        - Tested OK (normally) without it, although behaviour needs to be tested if audio or midi thread
           would stop unexpectedly.
      * Changed/Fixed: Thread priorites: Added command line switches for audio (-P) and midi (-Y). (T356)
        - Audio (-P) applies to dummy driver only. (Else audio priority is fixed by Jack).   
        - Also changed default settings so that no two threads have same priority. May fix problem reported
           by user GB, concerning high midi latency.
      * Added: Enable/disable LASH command line switch (-L), (if LASH support is compiled in). (T356)
        - Helps prevent some issues like auto-starting Jack, or automatically routing midi to fluidsynth (observed).
07.01.2010
      * Fixed: BUG ID: 2879426: *.med does not save meta event types. (T356)
        - Changed midievent.cpp MidiEventBase::write(). Now saves value A, B, C and sysex/meta data. Tested OK.  
      * Fixed: Midi meters now show for each track even if they're all on same device and channel. (T356)
        - Oversight, long overdue. The meters AND automation control needed to be 'per-track'.
      * Applied: muse-destdir.patch Scripts and utils packaging fix submitted by Orcan Ogetbil. (T356)
06.01.2010
      * Feature: Jack transport enable/disable in Midi Sync settings window. Stores setting per-song. (T356)
        - Should be Ok to use and test. Needs a bit more work. See jack.cpp and jackaudio.h
      * Fixed: Speedups of audio pre-fetch especially when moving the cursor around (seeking). (T356)
23.12.2009:
      * Added: DeicsOnze2 initial import. (ng)
      * Fix: deicsonzepreset.cpp for Xml muse 1 API
20.12.2009:
      =======================================
      * 1.0 tagged (rj)
      =======================================
19.12.2009:
      * Feature/Fix: Audio metronome: Send output tracks now selectable in Settings->Metronome. Also fixed bad noises.(T356)
15.12.2009:
      * Patch: New patch for 64-bit memory issues, from Daniel Kobras (rj)
      * Reworked: Output of configure script to point out deprecated stuff and list the interesting stuff (rj)
      * Fixed: Old bug: WaveTrack muting slow to respond or odd behaviour. (T356)
        - Removed track mute check in WaveTrack::fetchData(). Was causing 'delayed repeated muting' since the mute check is
           done at a time when audio segments are fetched which are to played a few seconds into the future.
          Tested OK so far, playing and bouncing wavetracks. Mute is now quick to respond and does not 'repeat' or 'delay'.
14.12.2009:
      * Fixed: Overhauled AudioTrack processing. Fixes noises if multiple output routes exist. Eliminates costly redundant
                processing of audio tracks, and their effects racks. Waves, groups, inputs, outputs, synths etc. (T356)
        - Made better use of AudioTrack::outBuffers, as a 'post-effect/pre-volume' caching mechanism if the track has more than one 
           output route. WaveTrack was already using this scheme, but I moved it up 'higher' and now all tracks benefit from it.
        - See AudioTrack::copyData() and ::addData(). Most changes there. (Comments included!)
      * Fixed: Old songs made before recent synth changes were not loading their synths. (T356)
        - In .med file, added synth 'label' tag to go with existing 'class' tag, to support synths like dssi-vst.
        - Songs made recently after the changes might not load their synths and will simply have to be re loaded and re-saved.
07.12.2009:
      * Fixed: Add Synth popup menu: Show names AND descriptions. Now sorted, too. Also separate MESS, DSSI, VST, and Other. (T356)
        - Added app.cpp:populateAddSynth() function.
      * Fixed: Increased buffers for reading xml. Song files with large patchdata from vstis caused crashes (rj)
      * Fixed: Self inflicted bug with setting initial song loading in general configuration (rj)
06.12.2009:
      * Fixed: List popup synths by description. Cleaned up soft synth main list. Added persistent names, descriptions, ver, etc. (T356)
05.12.2009:
      * Fixed: ddsi synths: Ticking or crackling when more than one output route path. (T356)
        - The synths were being run more than once per process cycle, due to multiple out routes eventually calling getData.
        - ** Work in progress - must also do MESS synths and other track types which should only process once per cycle. 
      * Feature: SSE support configure build option and SSE enabled dsp routines added. (T356)  
        - Currently none of the routines are actually used, yet... Borrowed from MusE-2.
        - They appear to only be enabled for 64-bit CPUs. Investigating why not 32-bit...
      * Feature: i386 optimized dsp float buffer copy routines. (T356)
        - Should work on all i386 compatible CPUs (uses asm movsl). Borrowed from MusE-2
        - I couldn't bear to add yet another unoptimized memcpy usage, so I added this.
      * Changed: All audio buffers now allocated with 'posix_memalign' instead of 'new'. (T356)
        - Borrowed from MusE-2.
03.12.2009:
      * Fixed: Support for initial vst chunk storage support if available in dssi-vst 
        requires a patch to dssi-vst.
      * Fixed: Better cleanup on closing MusE. (T356)
        - Added Song::cleanupForQuit called from Muse::closeEvent. Disconnect gracefully from LASH before app quit.
          Clean up memory. Make vst synth processes which were in undo or redo list at close go away.
02.12.2009:
      * Fixed: Do not send default midi values back to dssi synths. Let them handle their own default setting mechanisms. (T356)
        - Also saves a bit of loading time for synths with hundreds of controls. See MidiPort::setMidiDevice(). 
02.12.2009:
      * Fixed: dssi: Crashes when loading most vst synths. (T356)
        - All ports must be connected even if not used.
          Made sure all audio in/out and control in/out ports are connected,
           including latency control out port. Test Ok.
30.11.2009:
      * Added: Configuration option for vst plugin in-place processing, fixes ladspa vst plugins not working or loud feedback. (T356)
        - Hmmm, they were working before when I upgraded OS. Now they're not. Extensive testing: It seems this is not MusE's fault.
        - R.J. reports they weren't working too. Investigating...
29.11.2009:
      * Fixed: dssi: Loading of synths with more than 2 out channels. (T356)
        - Currently only the FIRST TWO channels of the synth will be used.
        - Tested ok so far with A.D. drumkit.
28.11.2009:
      * Fixed: dssi: List only synths found, not effect plugins. (T356)
        - Does the exact opposite of what dssi-vst does for ladspa plugins,
           therefore all plugins should be covered - effects will be listed 
           in ladspa effect dialog, while synths will be listed as synths.
27.11.2009:
      * Fixed: dssi: Both native guis and vst guis should open now. Ooooh - pretty! (T356)
        - ** But still: Keep an eye on your process list and manually kill any 
           synth instances lying around after exit. For now try to 'politely' 
           close dssi guis and delete any dssi synth tracks before exiting muse.
        - Working on gui open-close-reopen-show-hide stuff. Kinda weird esp. with vsts right now...
26.11.2009:
      * Fixed: Loading dssi crash bug. Should at least load them now. (T356)
        - Also some controller functionality via track controllers...
25.11.2009:
      * Feature: Dis.. Dis.. Disposable wha? (T356)
        - dssi support. Work in progress. 
        - ** VERY IMPORTANT Currently you must manually 'kill' any synth instances lying around after exit !!!
        - Should work OK for tests and fun...
22.11.2009:
      * Added: Support for reading ogg files through libsndfile (rj)
18.11.2009:
      * Fixed: Audio and synth tracks not processing when output path ultimately leads nowhere. (T356)
        - ALL tracks now always animate meters, and process audio 'quietly', and synth tracks
           process their gui messages, if output path leads nowhere.
        - This fixes a few problems: For example fluidsynth was not allowing loading of soundfonts.
          And synths would suddenly 'dump' any backlogged events when processing was turned back on.
          And during play, when disconnecting and reconnecting the track outputs, the audio would be 
           out of sync because it was not processed during that time.
        - See Audio::process1() to understand the changes more. Follow from there to SynthI, SynthIF etc.  
      * Fixed: Minor issue with port 0 display in track list port column for synths, from previous fix. (T356)  
17.11.2009:
      * Changed again: Arranger: Track list: Left click synth track's port column now lets you choose a port. (T356)
      * Fixed: Do not list synths as instruments in ports/synths settings window. (T356)
16.11.2009:
      * Added: Script functionality moved from PianoRoll to song class, available in main menu (under 'Midi') 
        and drum editor (mg)
      * Added: 'Add synth' sub-menus now automatically assign the instance to a free midi port. (T356)
15.11.2009:
      * Added: Added 'Add synth' sub-menu to main 'Edit menu' and Mixer 'Create' menu. (T356) 
      * Changed: All audio track types now start with two channels and 0db volume. (Input tracks remain muted as usual). (T356)
      * Fixed: Organ synth: Drawbar harmonics and sustain midi controllers were not working. (T356)
        - Applied auto-bias corrections.
14.11.2009:
      * Added: DoubleSpeed plugin script for PianoRoll (mg)
      * Fixed: Disable Python ifdefs (mg)
13.11.2009:
      * Feature: Mixer labels: Auto-Font-Size(TM) using Appearance Settings font # 6. Word wrap (only with spaces) supported. (T356)
        - The mixer labels will try to fit the text, trying font size from font #6 point size down to point size = 5.
      * Feature: Arranger: Track list: Right-click 'Add ...' now lists soft synths ! (T356)
      * Feature: Arranger: Track list: Left/right click synth track's output port column now shows synth gui ! (T356)
      * Changed: Midi track info: Removed redundant track name box, changed label to behave like mixer strip. (T356)
      * Fixed:   Appearance Settings: Manual entry into font name boxes now works. (T356)
      * Fixed:   Appearance Settings: Added tooltips to font #0 - #6. Explains which font does what. (T356)
12.11.2009:
      * Fixes: Some Python API refcount code added (mg)
10.11.2009:
      * Added: Effect disable/enable + add/remove track to Python API (mg)
09.11.2009:
      * Feature: Added 'Echo recording to output' button to midi track info panel. (T356)
        - Turns on or off echoing of incoming record events to output device.
      * Fixed: Midi tracks not recording when no output device selected. (T356)
        - Now tracks will record with no output device selected.
      * Fixed: Problems since increasing number of midi ports from 16 to 32 several months ago. (T356)
        - Added Xml::parseUInt() and ::uintTag(), utils.cpp:u32bitmap2String() and string2u32bitmap().
        - Fixed saving and loading of input port mask in med files.
        - Fixed display of input port mask in track info panel.
08.11.2009:
      * Added: First test shot at part managing app in Python (mg)
      * Added: Python api functions for selected track + import of part file (mg)
06.11.2009
      * Fixed: Python configure.ac problems. (T356)
      * Removed: musewidgetsplugin (QT3 Designer widgets plugin) which may cause CVS build to fail with libtool2. (T356)
        - Infamous '-o' trick no longer required to build from CVS. Removed until further notice. 
04.11.2009
      * Added: Shortcuts to drumeditor + pianoroll: goto current pos, scroll left + right (mg)
      * Fixed: Added command line switch (-y) for enabling Python control - disabled as default (mg)
      * Added: Shortcut keys added to pianoroll and drumeditor (mg)
      * Added: Startup dialog showing 'good to know' info, can be disabled (rj)
      * Added: Song info dialog, can be used to record song related arbitrary text information (rj)
      * Changed: the output limiter is now configurale, and by default off (rj)
      * Fixed: Midi loop recording now honours the transport cycle record mode setting. (T356)
        - Cycle mode REPLACE: Only record notes in current loop. Erase any previous loop notes from rec stop pos to loop end.
        - Cycle mode NORMAL: Same as REPLACE, but don't erase any previous loop notes from rec stop pos to loop end.
        - Cycle mode MIX: Keep all recorded notes from all loops.
        - Use the transport record mode OVERDUB or REPLACE as usual to either mix with or replace existing track notes.
      * Fixed: Midi record (incl. new part, looping, part auto-extend) now honours the arranger snap selection. (T356)
        - Previously the left and right ends of the part would always be 'snapped' to bars, and any new notes recorded 
           past the end would not snap the part.  
      * Changed: muse/mpevent.h: Changed MREL list from using audioRTalloc to midiRTalloc. (T356)
        - This must have been a mistake? midiRTalloc was not even being used anywhere before. The comment lines gave clues. 
      * Fixed: Multiple copies of wave events appearing in wave parts after resizing part. (T356)
        - Changed EventList::find() to respect wave or midi. D'oh! Missed this obvious one from changes I made many months ago.
      * Fixed: Audio loop recording now respects arranger snap setting. (T356)
        - Previously the left and right ends of the part would always be 'snapped' to bars.
      * Fixed: Audio recording now respects punchin and punchout points. (T356)  
      * Fixed: Audio loop recording now works (currently replace mode only). (T356)  
        - WORK IN PROGRESS: Only overwrite (replace) mode supported. Working on overdub mode...
        - If recording is started INSIDE the loop points, then allowed to loop, the
           'zeroth loop' wave contents will be 'shifted' back to the left loop point.
          This may have to change if mix mode is to be supported. In other words 
           keep that 'zeroth' portion of wave in place. May change it anyway. 
02.11.2009
      * Added: Midi track controller + audio track volume to Python interface (mg)
28.10.2009
      * Fixed: No, or badly shifted wave recording, since libsndfile 2008-05-11 (T356)
        - Fix for recorded waves being shifted ahead by an amount equal to start record position.
        - Removed _recFile->seek() in AudioTrack::record(). Since libsndfile 2008-05-11, "seeking past 
           end of file during write" is allowed, which caused problem with the line seeking the record
           file to an absolute frame which *included* the recording start position.
25.10.2009
      * Added: Mute functionality to Python interface (mg)
      * Fixed: Midi mixerstrip mute update issues (mg)
      * Fixed: initialization in pandelay ladspa plugin (rj) 
21.10.2009:
      * Added: functions for looping to Python interface (mg)
19.10.2009:
      * Added: more functions to Python interface: deletePart, set position of locators, get/set song 
      length, get division, set midi track parameters (mg)
      * Added: now possible to create and modify parts via Python bridge (mg)
18.10.2009
      * Added: backported ladspa plugins doublechorus and pandelay from svn-muse (rj)
      * Fixed: Mixer was not updating when a midi track's channel was changed. (T356)
        - Created a new song changed flag SC_MIDI_CHANNEL and used it to only update mixer midi strips,
           not the whole mixer. Changed AudioMixerApp::songChanged() and ::updateMixer().
      * Fixed: Mixer was not shrinking enough when a track was removed, leaving space between strips. (T356)
        - Added a couple of lines to AudioMixerApp::updateMixer() STRIP_REMOVED section.
      * Fixed: Bug with reading soundfonts from song dir fixed (rj)
17.10.2009
      * Examples: added some example scripts, DoNothing and RemoveShortEvents (currently requires PyQt4) (rj)
      * Added: more tags to plugin format in pianoroll, see readme in dist: share/scripts (rj)
      * Added: Updates to Python API, now possible to modify part data. Needs a lot of testing (mg)
16.10.2009
      * Added: Added a few functions to Python remote API (start/stop playback + location queries)
      * Feature: Each drum instrument listed in the drum map now has a playback 'volume' setting. (T356)
        - Currently it affects playback only. I am looking to maybe add record level, too.
      * Changed: Default drum map velocity level 3 (110) and 4 (127), now 127, 110. (T356)
        - To allow easy (no key hold) drawing of default 110 velocity notes.
          (Hold shift = 127, ctl= 90, shift+ctl = 70)
      * Fixed: Drum editor controller graphs now align perfectly with editor canvas. (T356)
        - Changed DrumEdit::newCanvasWidth().
        - Tested OK with various appearance themes, and various vertical splitter positions.
      * Fixed: Drum map length, velocity level, and volume columns rapid mid-/right- clicks causing left double-clicks. (T356)
        - Now the columns can be quickly mid and right clicked (decrement/increment).
      * Fixed: Fluidsynth now realizes that a soundfont was located in the song-dir and then omitts 
        the path in the configuration data. (rj)
      * Changed: Changed the format of the datafile for the automation option in the pianoroll
        Mathias, we can wrestle about it later ;-)   (rj)
15.10.2009
      * Feature: First version of MusE remote Python control (mg)
      * Fixed: Drum canvas 'select' functions not updating, can't copy/cut etc. (T356)
        - Added updateSelection() to the end of DrumCanvas::cmd(). Tested OK.
12.10.2009
      * Feature: External scripting functionality added via PianoRoll menu: (mg)
         PianoRoll scans INSTPREFIX/share/muse/scripts and ~/.muse/scripts for executables, which modify part 
         data via data stored in temporary file

25.08.2009
      * Proposal: new default colors for various stuff (rj)
12.08.2009
      * Fixed: bug 2811156, soft synth and marker window no longer appear when hidden for XFCE window manager (rj)
15.07.2009
      * Patch: from bug 2819312 (by Gerardo Exequiel Pozzi) added. Allows muse to launch with never glibc. The fix is
        perhaps not fully understood but it looks harmless. (rj)
09.07.2009
      * Changed: Track info program, vol, and pan spinboxes now lose focus with one enter press instead of two. (T356)
05.07.2009
      * Fixed: Small fix on behalf of T356, Jack should not be started if running -a (rj)
      * Fixed: Help menu -> Report a Bug: Set address to current muse org bug address. (T356)
01.07.2009
      * Fixed: Dropdown menus in transport no longer grab focus, make space start/stop work again (rj)
      * Fixed: Dropdown in Mastertrack editor no longer grabs focus (rj)
      * Feature: Added denormal protection, by default on, can be turned off in global config (rj)
25.06.2009
      * Fixed: Recording of midi sysex was not working. (T356)
        - My fault since recent midi sync changes. Fixed the last few lines in alsaProcessMidiInput().
      * Fixed: Segfault when certain movements are done in track list. (T356)
        - Added valid track check to RESIZE section of TList::mouseMoveEvent(), 
           and a few other places.
23.06.2009
      * Testing: A fix for some Jack-2 net problems...  (T356)
        - Added missing break statements, and JackTransportNetStarting detection 
           (hard-coded as '4' for now so that muse will build with Jack 1 and 2 - we need 
           config detection of Jack version!) to processSync(), and JackAudioDevice::getState().
21.06.2009
      * Feature: Added Jack freewheel mode. (T356)
        - Dramatically speeds up bounce to file and bounce to track operations.
          With freewheel enabled, you don't have to wait for Muse to play the song 
           at normal speed while bouncing - it goes as fast as possible.
        - Added configuration option for it. See 'Global Settings -> Audio'.
20.06.2009
      =======================================
      * 1.0rc3 tagged (rj)
      =======================================
      * Feature: Jack transport master functionality added. (T356)
        - Allows other Jack client apps to properly disply Muse's current bar, beat, and tick.
        - Especially useful for songs with tempo and time signature changes.
        - It is activated / deactivated by clicking on Muse's transport 'Master', 
           or Muse's graphic Mastertrack window 'Enable'.
17.06.2009
      * Fixed: Segfault after creating simpledrums instance, then adding a midi track. (T356)
        - Return non zero in SimpleSynth::getPatchName().
15.06.2009
      * Removed: Some code in jack driver which may cause shutdowns or static noise with Jack version 1 (T356)
        - Tested several hours here, no shutdowns or sudden static noise. Thanks to the Jack team for that one...
13.06.2009
      * Fixed: New midi right-click popup menu 'add/set event' and 'erase event' not working for drum controllers. (T356)
        - Also, on 'add/set', added check and ignore if an existing event value is already equal. 
      * Fixed: Midi track info vol, pan, prog 'Rec' buttons were allowing duplicate events. (T356)
        - Added check for existing event in Song::recordEvent().
        - Also added check and ignore if event value is already equal.
10.06.2009
      * Fixed: Link error concerning libmidiedit.a and CtrlEdit.a (T356)
        - Somehow the list of link libraries was out of order. Reordered, tested OK.
05.06.2009
      * Fixed: Users in some locales reported audio automation save/load corruption. (T356)
        - Changed CtrlList::read() to use QString and QLocale instead of strtol() and strtod().
        - Checked: Other places using QString::toDouble() work OK because QString will fallback 
           to 'C' locale if formatting using current locale fails. (Hmm... But is it a speed hit?)
      * Fixed: When linking, get errors concerning uuid functions not found. (T356)
        - Added a section in configure.ac to test for uuid.h and libuuid.
        - Added uuid lib to list of linked libs.
      * Fixed: Midi port controller values not erased upon song load. (T356)
        - There were leftover ghost values in the controller graphs between song loads.
        - Added MidiCtrlValListList::clearDelete(), called from Song::clear().
      * Added: Right-click automation popup menu to all midi controller knobs/sliders. (T356)
        - Contains add/set event, and erase event.
        - When activated by the muse mixer midi controls, it 'prefers' selected parts on the track
           over unselected parts, otherwise it chooses the first part found. If no part is found, 
           it creates a new one to contain the event.
        - When activated by pianoroll or drum editor controller graph, it uses the currently 
           selected part (within the editor).
        - Adding 'previous event', 'next event', 'erase range' and 'clear automation', just like
           the audio automation popup menu, will take more time. Not implemented yet.
      * Disabled: Midi mixer strip automation type button. (T356)
        - There is no midi automation recording mechanism (yet). Disabled to avoid confusion with users.
      * Added: Some new instrument .idf files submitted by MST (Michael). (T356) 
        - Akai SG01v, Korg MS2000R, Korg X5DR, Korg X50, Waldorf MicroQ.
02.06.2009
      * Applied: Some patches by Mandriva packagers. (T356)
        - muse-1.0-fix-str-fmt.patch for deicsonze printf fix.
        - muse-1.0-linkage.patch fixes compiler hang up at deicsonze.cpp.
01.06.2009
      * Fixed: Instrument editor 'Save as' was not working right. (T356)
        - Was overwriting existing instrument.
        - Now prompts for new instrument name.
      * Added text in ctrl view to explain how to add controller values (rj)

24.05.2009
      * Fixed: Missing uuid header in two files. (T356)
        - My fault. Added include uuid/uuid.h to songfile.cpp and pcanvas.cpp.
      * Fixed: Bounce to track: Wrong message "Select one audio output track", to "Select one target wave track". (T356)
        - My fault. Message is displayed when there is one output and one or more wave tracks, and the user has clicked 
           on the output but not a track, too.
      * Added: Start 'Wave editor' edit menu item, with configurable shortcut key. (T356)
        - This will handle multiple wave part editing. The existing right-click wave part popup menu
           'wave edit' item did that too, but now has been reverted back to opening a single 
           wavepart only, just like midi parts. 
      * Streamlined: All reading of 'part' xml is now done by a new routine. (T356)
        - Replaced new PartCanvas::readClone(), and existing Part::read(), with standalone readXmlPart(),
           in order to block creation of parts with mis-matched type, which don't belong on a track.
        - Allowed mixed part .mpt files (midi and wave), and made a new clipboard type 'text/mixedpart'.
        - Mixed part files can be dragged, imported or pasted to either a wave or midi track, and only the 
           relevant parts will be created. 
        - Added warning dialog showing how many, of how many total, parts couldn't be created.
        - Added a parameter to Event::write() and EventBase::write() to force full wave file paths to be stored.
          Used for copying, pasting, dragging, importing, exporting parts, but not for the song file itself.
       * Added: Right-click wave part popup menu now has 'export', just like midi parts. (T356)
        - As mentioned above, the full wave path is stored so there's minimum confusion when re-loading 
           the export, unless of course the file moved or was deleted etc.
       * Fixed: Some issues with clones, controller events, and port controller values. (T356)
        - It means "What you see on the controller graph is what you get, when you move the play cursor."
          Port controller values are used when moving the cursor, they make the knobs move and send
           values to the midi port. However, during play, they are not used, the song's controller events
           themselves are used. Synchronizing these two mechanisms is what this is all about.
          Fortunately, during play, "What you see on the controller graph" is ALWAYS correct, and is sent 
           to the midi port. 
        - TODO: Not quite done yet. Some functions may not update port controller values properly still,
           like splitting or gluing clone parts.
06.05.2009
      =======================================
      * 1.0rc2 tagged (rj)
      =======================================

02.05.2009
      * Feature: Right-click popup menu on a clone part now has "Select N clones", where N is number of clones. (T356)
        - Major addition: Part "clone chaining system". (See part.cpp for new functions). Speeds up searches for clones.
      * Feature: Added 'Paste clone' to arranger edit menu. Pastes clones of copied parts. (T356)
        - 'Paste' will behave as always, only making a fresh copy of non-clone parts, while cloning clone parts.
        - 'Paste clone' will always make a clone no matter if the parts are clones or non-clones.
      * Feature: Added 'Paste to track' and 'Paste clone to track' to arranger edit menu. (T356)
        - 'Paste' (and 'Paste clone') now attempt to paste to the original track(s) which the parts belonged to, 
           or if the original track has been deleted, then the current track. 
          'Paste to track' and 'Paste clone to track' paste all copied parts to the currently selected track, 
           which was the previous behaviour of 'Paste'.
        - Much work went into making sure that all scenarios work with these features, like copy/paste, drag/drop, 
           drag/drop .mpt part files, drag/drop between different instances of muse etc.
      * Fixed: Importing or dragging midi part file (.mpt) into muse now supports multiple parts in the file. (T356)
        - Changed MusE::importPartToTrack().  
      * Fixed: Midi record into existing part past part end, in 'Replace' record mode, works now. (T356)
        - Finished an erase events 'TODO' block in Song::cmdAddRecordedEvents.
      * Fixed: Midi record into existing part, past part end, was decreasing part aref count, causing de-clone of clones. (T356)
        - Removed extra "part->events()->incARef(-1)" from Song::cmdAddRecordedEvents().
      * Changed: Number of midi ports from 16 to 32. (T356)     
      * Added: Muse application desktop file, and added installation of it plus the muse icon, upon 'make install'. (T356)
        - Desktop file submitted by Orcan Ogetbil.
        - Note if muse is installed to /usr/local, the desktop file might not find the icon.
      * Fixed: "-mcpu= is deprecated" compiler warnings. (T356)
        - Changed configure.ac to use -mtune and -march.
      * Speedups: Some heartBeat routines (such as Meter) were constantly drawing, wasting time and causing flicker. (T356)
        - Also fixed Track Info midi detect light, and Midi Sync lights.
      * Fixed: Midi strip vu meters now have a peak indicator. (T356)
      * Fixed: Audio mixer strips now update when config minimum meter/slider value changed. (T356)
        - Also fixed blocky 'aliased' drawing at low signals / low minimum meter settings.
        - Changed Track::_meter and ::_peak from ints to doubles for more accuracy, eliminate 'false' draw update triggers.
      * Added: Configurable shortcut key: "Transport: Goto start". Default 'W' key (as in reWind to start). (T356)
      * Added: Appearance configuration button: Clear background picture. (T356)
        - Also fixed Appearance::apply() to clear the string if <none> selected.
        - Also fixed Arranger::configChanged() to set canvas null background QPixmap.
        - This means clearing the filename in the 'select picture' dialog also works now. 
      * Changed: Selected cloned parts now draw (inverted) dashed border, just like unselected parts. (T356)
      * Changed: Part drag-clone key from Shift-Ctrl back to Alt. (T356)
        - My fault. Was changed to Shift-Ctrl, but Ctrl is for selecting all items in a row or limiting movement to x or y. 
        - Still not a good thing. Some desktops even reserve Alt, Shift-Alt etc. for window move, snap etc.
        - TODO: Must find a way to override desktop setting. Without Alt, we don't have enough keys to work with!
          Don't want user to have to disable setting.
      * Cleanups: Moved some methods outside of Part and Track classes which I had put inside them. (T356)
        - Methods like addPortCtrlEvents() deletePortCtrlEvents() etc.
      * Changed: Muse wants qt >= 3.2, but some .ui files had version 3.3. (T356)
        - Changed editinstrumentbase, editgainbase, aboutbox, configmidifilebase, gensetbase, midisync, 
           fluidsynthguibase, and vamguibase .ui files.
      * Fixed: Midi Track info panel was allowing track name change to an already existing name. (T356)
        - Fixed Arranger::iNameChanged() to warn. Changing the name in the arranger Track List already warns OK.
      * Fixed: Crash or bizarre behaviour when undoing a track rename operation. (T356)
        - Replaced default simple Track class assignment operator with custom method. Added a flag parameter to 
           Track::clone and Track copy constructors to indicate partlist is simply assigned, not parts cloned. 
           Also removed the lines reassigning each part's track (!). Can get away with this since track rename 
           is the only operation to use that, but something better would be needed if more 'normal' behaviour 
           was needed in copy constructor and assignment operator !
05.04.2009
      * Fixed: Arranger part cloning works now! (Hold shift-ctrl while moving part - note dashed border on cloned parts). (T356)
        - In Song::cmdChangePart() do not call "oldPart->events()->incARef(-1)" if new part is clone of old part,
           (that is, old/new parts' eventlists point to same eventlist).
        - Changed from 'alt' to 'Shift-Ctrl' button combo to activate cloning in Canvas::viewMousePressEvent().
          Alt is reserved for moving the whole window (on my machine), so most people probably never knew about cloning? 
        - This also fixes a reference count problem when renaming a part, ref count was being dec'd past 0. 
          Quite possibly fixes some other issues, too. Testing...
      * Fixed: Transport window was disappearing by itself. (T356)
        - Removed WStyle_Tool from Transport constructor. Seems to test Ok now.
        - Gave it a caption "Muse: Transport", to appear on task bar.
      * Fixed: Big time display now shows MTC minutes, seconds, frames, and subframes. (T356)
      * Fixed: Wave editor MTC cursor time readout was not right. (T356)
        - Use samplepos to set pos2 value in WaveEdit::setTime().
03.04.2009
      * Followup: Track info panel program, volume, and pan were not allowing editing values. (T356)
        - Fixed the track info heartBeat function.
      * Followup: Some more changes to respect MidiDevice open flags, set in midi config window. (T356)
        - Strangely, midi config 'write enable' lights still weren't stopping events from being played, 
           even though the port was clearly unsubscribed successfully for writing (!) 
          Also, strangely, only if Jack Midi was disabled, some device putEvent() error messages were appearing.
          I expected the messages to ALWAYS occur but it didn't happen, even though events were always played. 
        - Added MidiDevice::_writeEnable and ::_readEnable, set when the device is opened or closed. 
        - Changed the various ::putEvent methods to respect _writeEnable. (_readEnable not used yet, because
           port unsubscribtion for reading IS working - events stop arriving).
      * Added: Instrument definition file for playing to an Emu 4MBGSMT SoundFont. (T356)
01.04.2009
      * Fixed: Midi config window: Clicking on green in/out enable lights was not actually dis/enabling in/out. (T356)
        - As initiated from MPConfig::rbClicked(), MidiAlsaDevice::close() was seeing the NEW flags, not the old.
          So, in MidiAlsaDevice::close(), removed _openFlags check, and added snd_seq_get_port_subscription() check.
        - Tested Ok disabling/enabling ins/outs, and clearing/setting port's device.
      * Fixed: Muse was not storing midi port 'openFlags' in the song files. (T356)
        - Muse could read the old 'record' flag and the new 'openFlags' tags, but only stored the 
           old 'record' tag (well, it was actually storing rwFlags by mistake).
        - Added the necessary tag to file write. (Related to the fix above - now it stores the port in/out enable).
01.04.2009
      * Fixed: Compile problem with muse widgets plugin "undefined reference to `main'". (T356)
          - Added -c to musewidgetsplugin_so_CPPFLAGS in muse/widgets/Makefile.am
          - Re-ran automake, configure, built, tested ok.
          - To be tested by users...
      * Fixed: Compile error: "editctrlbase.cpp:53: error: invalid use of incomplete type 'struct PosEdit'" (T356)
          - Added a <customwidget> section to editctrlbase.ui
          - To be tested by users...
31.03.2009
      * Feature: Midi file export: Configuration options added for 2 or 4 byte time signatures + note off optimizations. (T356)
        - For 4 byte timesigs: Add fixed "metronome" value of 24 (once per quarter-note), and "32nd notes per quarter-note" value of 8. 
        - For note off optimizations: Replace note offs with zero velocity note ons.   
      * Fixed: Midi track info panel now updates when external changes occur, such as keyboard program changes. (T356)
        - Changed track info window from songChanged based updates to periodic heartBeatTimer based updates.
      * Feature: Added midi input detect indicator to track info panel. (T356)
        - Detects all note on-off, controller, aftertouch, program change, and pitchbend (but not sysex or realtime) 
           events on the selected channels, on the selected midi ports.  
      * Fixed: Midi program adjustment controls now respond when external program changes occur. (T356)    
        - Added a section to handle ME_PROGRAM in MidiPort::sendEvent(), so that visual controls can update,
           such as trackinfo 'program' , and pianoroll 'program' controller adjustment knob.
      * Fixed: Some issues with 'Follow Song' setting and position cursor position/visibility. (T356)
        - Added 'xorg' in ppos calculations in Canvas::setPos() (and others like WaveView, but that still isn't quite right.)
        - For windows which have an appreciable x origin (space at the left of the contents), the play cursor was 
           too far right or not visible sometimes, especially with large horizontal zoom, particularly the arranger.
          With 'Follow Continuous', the play cursor should now stay about in the middle of the windows. 
          With 'Follow Page', the view should now more or less always move in full 'pages'. 
27.03.2009
      * Fixed: Track info 'instrument patch' list box was not correct when selecting another track with unknown patch. (T356)
        - Broken last fixes.
      * Improved: Support for & < > \ " characters in xml files. (T356)
        - Fixed xml.cpp
        - Many places in muse can now use them (ex. track name, instrument names/patches/controllers etc.)
        - TODO: Writing: Must still check for places which manually use Xml::nput, put etc, but at least muse 
           should now read them all without trouble.
      * Fixed: Instrument Editor was still asking to save sometimes even if user clicked save already. (T356)
        - Call instrumentNameReturn() patchNameReturn() and ctrlNameReturn() from various places, to force update.
      * Feature: Redesigned Midi Sync Editor and sync system. To allow multiple inputs/outputs, and more. (T356)
        - See tooltips or click on What's This to see detailed explanations of each item.
        - TODO: Only realtime MC events are tested at the moment. MMC and MTC are not tested, or not working yet. 
        - TODO: Fix midi sync clock input. Observed problems: wandering, even reversing(!) song cursor time.
          Can be stored in .med file that way (tempomap->fix is negative number!) making a bad file which won't play.
12.03.2009
      * Fixed: Global configuration dialog 'Displayed Resolution', and added 'Midi Resolution' boxes. (T356) 
        - Separate midi/gui configurations were allowed, but not implemented. 
        - TODO: Now make the 'Displayed Resolution' setting actually do something.
          The 'Midi Resolution' currently sets BOTH what should be separated into midi and gui.
          Only config.division is used throughout muse, not config.guiDivision.
          Also, now that these settings are working, they reveal some issues with drawing, such as
           not enough pianoroll zoom-out ability with high resolution.
      * Improved: Midi Clock output. Was improper, causing external devices to misbehave. (T356)
        - Changed MidiSeq::processTimerTick().
        - Tested: With RTC resolution at 8192, the target device slowly drifted out of phase with muse after 
          about 20 bars. With RTC resolution at 1024 it was actually more stable (100 bars or more), despite 
          more clock jitter.
          Used an equalization scheme to balance the time out. Must test if stability improves without this scheme. 
          MidiSeq::processTimerTick() still needs some tweaking. 
        - You may see severe phase difference if moving the cursor around and playing. Try playing from the song start.  
19.02.2009
      * Patch: Patch to find best available ALSA timer. (T356)
        - Submitted by Pedro Lopez-Cabanillas. Patch was named "muse_alsatimer_2nd.patch".
        - "This patch adds selection logic to ALSA timer initialization, trying to find 
            the best available ALSA timer (a non slave timer with lowest resolution).
           Currently muse uses only the ALSA system timer, even when the system has an 
           ALSA RTC or ALSA HPET drivers available, which are probably better for many users."
      * Patch: Patches for printf%zd/size_t, and grepMidi/gcc4.4 issues, and fix some compiler warnings. (T356)
        - Submitted by Orcan Ogetbil.
        - Patches were named muse-size_t.patch, muse-gcc44.patch, and muse-fix-some-compilation-warnings.patch
      * Fixed: Some more issues with manipulating drum tracks and underlying controller events. (T356)
        - Changing a drum track's output port, (and allowing muse to change the whole drum map),
           was not changing existing port controller values.
        - Also changing a track from 'midi' <-> 'drum' was not changing the port controller values properly.   
        - NOTE: I still observed occasional 'ghost' midi port controller values. Tracking this issue...
      * Fixed: Seek or Init Instrument with XG instrument caused double loading of controller init values. (T356) 
        - Moved controller init code from MidiPort::sendGm/XgOn() to a new MidiPort::sendGm/Gs/XgInitValues() 
           and changed Audio::initDevices() to call them.
      * Added: 'Value' readout on menu toolbar (beside 'Cursor' readout), in Drum Editor. (T356)
        - Just like pianoroll, except it only shows controller values. 
        - Now you can read the values you are drawing on the Drum Editor controller graph.
      * Fixed: Some issues with configuration, and appearance window. (T356)
        - Muse now remembers configured 'selected track foreground/background' colours. 
        - Added "Midi Editor -> controller graph" colour configuration option (default navy blue).
        - Fixed Arranger and Style/Fonts windows not showing current values.
      * Fixed: Segfault with Appearance configured to show events, with a part tick > 0 on part canvas. (T356)
        - Added limit checks on from/to variables in PartCanvas::drawItem().
      * Fixed: Midi controller graphs were displaying 'quantization' vertical lines instead of 'snap' lines. (T356)
        - Changed CtrlCanvas::draw() to use raster instead of quant value.
        - Also changed gray background colour to darkGray, so 'major' snap lines can be seen.
      * Added: Send 'null' midi controller parameters after each RPN/NRPN controller event. (T356)
        - Symptom: After muse sends any RPN/NRPN controller event, operating the 'data' (MSB/LSB) 
           midi controllers affects that RPN/NRPN controller.
        - Cause: The RPN/NRPN parameters are still active, open to any subsequent data adjustments.
        - Cure: Send 'null' parameters after each RPN/NRPN event, so that subsequent data adjustments
           are sent there instead.
        - Added adjustable 'null' parameter numbers to the instrument editor. Typically they should 
           be '127/127', but they are adjustable (select an unused controller number) if desired.
          They can also be turned off, if desired, by selecting 'off/off', so that muse will NOT send
           them. Turning them off is useful for instruments which do not use RPN/NRPN controllers.
      * Changed: GS/XG instrument patches high banks from 18 to 128, 17 to 127, and 5 to 65. (T356)
        - Was it a typo? XG specifications say high banks should be 128, 127, 65 etc.
        - Also, in instrument editor, reorganized XG Drum patches into Drum Kits and Sound FX.
        - TODO: Other instruments may have to be changed, too.
      * Fixed: Track info 'Rec' button: If new part was created, it was too short even to see. (T356)
        - Changed Song::recordEvent to round (tick + 1) up one bar.
        - Added separate record buttons for program (and bank), volume, and pan.
18.02.2009
      * Added: Missing midi program controller to pianoroll/drum edit controller graph and adjustment knob. (T356)
        - Since the range is limited to 1-128, this only edits the program byte, NOT the program MSB or LSB!
        - Since only the program byte is edited, adding new values to the graph uses the CURRENT 
           program MSB and LSB, as shown in the track info pane (H-Bank/L-Bank). 
           If the current program is 'unknown' (all off), then the graph uses MSB=off, LSB=off if the song type 
            is GM, and MSB=1, LSB=1 if not.  
        - I considered using the 'previous value' on the graph for the MSB/LSB, but then there would be 
           no way to quickly set the MSB/LSB when adding new values to the graph.
        - The only other way is to draw on the graph, and then use the midi event list editor to change 
           the program MSB/LSB values.
        - TODO: Fix the track info H-Bank/L-Bank/Program behaviour. Do not allow program to be 'off' 
           if H-Bank/L-Bank are not 'off'.
      * Changed: Instrument editor behaviour. Allow a 'user' instrument directory PLUS the 'built-in' directory. (T356)
        - Muse now looks first in the MUSEINSTRUMENTS directory (default MUSEHOME/muse_instruments, where MUSEHOME  
           is default HOME/), then looks in the 'built-in' instrument directory (/usr/share/muse etc.)
        - Instruments found in the user directory OVERRIDE instruments with the SAME NAME in the 'built-in' directory.
        - This allows users to quickly experiment with existing instruments while keeping the same instrument name.
        - TODO: add a 'Delete' button to the instrument editor.
      * Added: Pitch bend sensitivity controller to fluidsynth. (T356) 
      * Fixed: Organ synth: Volume not working. (T356)
        - There is no volume gui control to return proper min/max values.
        - Added a trap for CTRL_VOLUME in Organ::getControllerInfo() and
           set min/max to 0/127.
      * TODO: Fix some broken VAM synth midi controllers with improper range. (T356)     
09.02.2009
      * Fixed: Drum map: Grey vertical lines not proper when map header rearranged. (T356)
        - Used header->mapToSection when drawing grey vertical lines in dlist.cpp.
08.02.2009
      * Fixed: Drum map - Changing ANote, Channel, Port now updates controller graph and knob. (T356)
        - Changing ANote, Channel, or Port of a drum map item now updates the controller graph 
           and adjustment knob. Useful for XG/GS drum controllers.
        - TODO: Fix 'Undo' changing ANote, Channel, Port.
      * Fixed: Drum map - List item drag and drop works properly now. (T356)
        - Was not manipulating events properly, although port controller values were still OK.
          Useful for XG/GS drum controllers.
        - TODO: Fix 'Undo' of drag and drop.
      * Changed: All calls to some new message sending routines with direct calls. (T356)
        - Replaced all calls to msgSetTrackOutChannel, msgSetTrackOutPort, msgRemapPortDrumCtlEvents,
           and msgChangeAllPortDrumCtrlEvents, with direct calls (song->remapPortDrumCtlEvents etc.),
           bracketed by audio->msgIdle(true) and audio->msgIdle(false).
        - For complex operations, 'msgIdle' technique seems to be preferred over sending messages.
        - Tested such operations while in stop mode, and while playing. Tested OK.
06.02.2009
      * Changed: Hard coded LADSPA paths in plugin.cpp and ssplugin.cpp to include /usr/lib64/ladspa  
           and /usr/local/lib64/ladspa. (T356)
        - Suggested by Orcan Ogetbil    
        - Note that the environment variable LADSPA_PATH still overrides these hard-coded paths.
06.02.2009
      * Patch applied: Removes duplicate implementation of fast_log*() functions in ssplugin.h (T356)
        - Submitted by Orcan Ogetbil 
05.02.2009
      =======================================
      * 1.0rc1 tagged (rj)
      =======================================
04.02.2009
      * Fixed: Track info panel 'Rec' button not changing existing values on controller graph. (T356)
        - Name changes: MidiCtrlValList::add, ::del, ::find to ::addMCtlVal, ::delMCtlVal, ::findMCtlVal 
           to make it easier to spot all usages of them.
        - Simple fix in MidiCtrlValList::addMCtlVal: Return false if the value is already found for the part.
        - TODO: It takes three 'undos' to undo the 'Rec' button push. It is because prog, vol, and pan
           are changed. This should be unified into one undo...

01.02.2009
      * Fixed: Compile error on 64-bit systems, in audiotrack.cpp at cacheJackRouteNames(). (T356)
        - Changed from unsigned int pair key, which required pointer conversion, to AudioTrack* pair key. 
        - Test OK (on my 32-bit system). ** Need 64-bit users to test it. **
      * Fixed: Segfault when playing a note in a drum map, when the note's port says 'none'. (T356)
        - Added a line in the 'don't echo controller changes back to software synthesizer' block of
           Audio::processMidi(), to check valid device.
      * Fixed: Missing or stuck notes or events on recording (or rec-armed only) midi track. (T356)
        - Symptom: Playing live (rec-armed only), or recording, on a midi track gives stuck or 
           missing notes and other events. Very annoying bug!
        - Cause: A single list was used for recording midi events, while muse was also reading from that list.
        - Employed a 'flipping' two-list technique for MidiDevice::recordEvents().
        - In Audio::processMidi(), process one list while MidiDevice::recordEvent() writes to the other.
      * Fixed: Manipulating controller events in midi track parts was not changing midi port controller values. (T356)
        - Symptom: Change a part's midi controller events, or move or delete a part, or delete a track, then the underlying
           midi port's controller values are not altered, leading to 'phantom' or 'ghost', or duplicate controller values,
           even where there is no part or no track, or no controller values where there should be !
        - Oops, how did this major bug go unnoticed so long?...   
        - Major rewrite: Created a struct MidiCtrlVal{int val, Part* part}, and changed class MidiCtrlValList from
           std::map<int, int>  to  std::multimap<int, MidiCtrlVal>
          Changed MidiCtrlValList::add(int tick, int value) to MidiCtrlValList::add(int tick, int value, Part* part),
           and MidiCtrlValList::del(int tick) to MidiCtrlValList::del(int tick, Part* part),
           and added MidiCtrlValList::find(int tick, Part* part).
          Changed Song::addEvent(), Song::changeEvent(), Song::deleteEvent(), Song::addPart(), Song::changePart(), 
           Song::removePart(), Song::insertTrack2(), and Song::removeTrack2() to make sure port controller values 
           are added/removed properly.
          Changed a few other things to make it all work. 
          Reasons: The Part* member was added to each controller value item in the list, so that the system can 
           know exactly which part was responsible for putting a value in the list.
          This helps when we have overlapping controller values from events of different parts on the same port and the same channel - 
           if one of the parts is deleted or moved, the overlapping values from the events of the other part are NOT disturbed
           within the port's controller value list. 
          The list was changed from 'map' to 'multimap' to accommodate the multiple values from events of different parts.
         - NOTE: When there are overlapping values from events of different parts, the system will arbitrarily choose the
           first value it finds at a given time. I considered 'mixing' the overlapping values together
           (by averaging, or maybe highest/lowest value), but I felt it would just cause more confusion for the user.
          Therefore it is up to the user to be aware of overlapping controller events and deal with them.
          If you are looking at a controller graph and it shows a particular value at some time, but the 
           midi knobs/sliders and actual midi output does NOT correspond to what you are seeing, then 
           most likely ANOTHER part on the same port and channel has an event at that same time, and that 
           event's value is likely the one that is being used by the system.
      * Fixed: Changing a midi track's out port or channel was not updating the ports' controller values. (T356)
        - Changed MidiTrack::setOutPort() and MidiTrack::setOutChannel() calls to new MidiTrack::setOutPortAndUpdate() 
           and MidiTrack::setOutChanAndUpdate(), which make sure the port's controller value list is properly updated.
        - Part of the larger fixes above.   
      * Fixed: Midi adjustment knob on controller canvas was not working after moving the part to another track. (T356)
        - Added some code to CtrlCanvas::songChanged() to set curPart and curTrack and update the knob,
           upon SC_PART_MODIFIED.
      * Fixed: Clear midi input transforms when song cleared. Update transform dialog when song changed. (T356)
        - Symptom: Repeated loading of songs causes duplication of midi transforms, causing .med song files to grow big !
        - Added clearMidiInputTransforms() to midiitransform.cpp, called by Song::clear().
        - Added updatePresetList() and slot songChanged() to MidiInputTransformDialog, triggered by Song::songChanged.
        - Added some code to readMidiInputTransform() to **auto-eliminate** duplicate transforms in existing .med files.
        - Still some 'quirkiness' with the dialog buttons, but it works better now.
        - ALSO: Applied those same fixes to midi transforms and the midi transform dialog.
      * Fixed: Notes not recorded to track for a drum map 'instrument item' having non-default (track) port. (T356)
        - Changed to drumRecEvent.setPort(port) in 'Track::DRUM' section of 'if(recording)' section of Audio::processMidi()
           so that buildMidiEventList() would accept the notes.
      * Fixed: Removed jack midi port names from audio in/out port lists. (T356)
        - Added JACK_DEFAULT_AUDIO_TYPE to jack_get_ports calls in JackAudioDevice::inputPorts and ::outputPorts.
      * Fixed: Notes were being mixed up when switching a track type between midi and drum. (T356)
        - Changed to drumMap[pitch].enote in 'Drum -> Midi' section of TList::classesPopupMenu().
      * Completed: Moving multiple events from multiple parts when editing in pianoroll or drum editor. (T356)
        - Work had begun several commits ago. Completed.
        - Now you can select and move multiple events from different parts in the editors.
      * Feature: When editing multiple parts in the pianoroll or drum editor, controller graphs are now overlaid! (T356)
        - When you are editing more than one part at a time in the editors, the controller graph will overlay
           all of the graphs together!
        - The currently selected part will show its controller as normal blue columns, as before, but the other 
           unselected parts will draw their controllers as a gray 'ghost' outline on top.
        - TODO: Add menu items, hot keys etc. to cycle through each part (in case there are no notes to select in a part!)
      * Improved: Support for GS/XG midi drum controllers. (T356)
        - Added MidiPort::drumController(). Tells if an event is a drum controller event, according to the port's instrument.
          Does it by looking up the event in the instrument's controller list.
          Would prefer a 'marker flag', eg use the event 'dataA' high bit to mark as drum controller event, but it's too risky!
          Used MidiPort::drumController() a dozen or so places where drum controller events needed remapping/manipulation etc.
          May be a speed hit with many/large controller graphs? Test further...
        - Added code to update port controller values when changing drum map ANote, channel, or port.
        - KNOWN BUGS: Still a few loose ends to tie up: Port controller values (but not track events) may not be correct when: 
           'Swapping' (by dragging) items in the drum map, and
           loading a song with a drum map which had 'swapped' (by dragging) items.
          Some stuff (midi value adjustment knob) is not updated when changing drum map ANote, channel, or port. 
          Workaround: Be sure to select another drum map item, then reselect the changed item again, after such operations.
      * Changed: All softsynth midi controllers now have default initial values. (T356)
        - Added default initial values to all softsynth controllers such as fluidsynth's controller map.
        - Added 'initval' argument to all ::getControllerInfo() methods, which is passed to the newly created 
           controller (new MidiController) in SynthI::initInstance().
        - These initial values will then show on the various gui midi adjustment controls, knobs etc.
      * Changed: Fluidsynth master gain and reverb initial settings. Gain was too loud and there was too much reverb. (T356)
      * Fixed: Follow up - some issues with instrument editor. (T356)
        - Instrument editor was sometimes falsely detecting instrument had changed. 
        - Also, do not list 'internal' instruments like generic midi, soft synths, vst etc.
        - Also, upon 'Save As', prompt for a new instrument name if the user hasn't changed it, to avoid duplicates.
        - Remove any unsaved (new) instrument when moving to another instrument, closing etc.
        - Fixed up tab order of instrument editor controls.
        - TODO: When muse wants to close, trap it in the instrument editor so we can save.
      * Fixed: Problem in xml parser. '&amp', '&quot' etc were being read as '&&', '""' etc. (T356)
        - Added a couple of lines, and removed one, in Xml::stoken().
      * Fixed: Zero bias midi controllers (with a negative minimum value, like 'pan') weren't working right. (T356)
        - Broken after last changes. Added an updateBias() line to MidiController::read() 'controller' tag end section.
      * Added: Send all instrument controller initial (default) values to all of a port's midi channels, 
           except where explicitly initialized by the song. (T356)
        - Added some code to MidiPort::setMidiDevice to initialize controllers from instrument, if needed.
        - When setting a midi port's device (such as in Settings->Midi Ports, or simply when loading a song),
           then any specified controller initial values in the instrument are sent to ALL of the port's channels, 
           EVEN if the controller is NOT in the song. This ensures better consistency between songs, so that 
           chosen controllers are not left in undesirable 'leftover' states. 
          (Taken from important comments in MidiPort::setMidiDevice(): )
          For example: A song is loaded which has a 'reverb level' controller initial value of '100'.
          Then a song is loaded which has no such controller (hence no explicit initial value).
          The 'reverb level' controller would still be at '100', and could adversely affect the song,
           but if the instrument has an available initial value of say '0', it will be used instead.
        - It is desirable to have defaults for some controllers, but it is wise to have NO default for certain 
           other controllers, like the 'reset all controllers' and 'sustain' controllers (actually, zero would be OK).
      * Changed: Clicking Midi->InitInstrument (or moving to song position 0) now initializes controllers
          from instrument controller initial values, if they exist, or previously hard coded values if not. (T356)
        - sendGmOn() and sendXgOn(), which are called via Audio::initDevices(), now use instrument controller
           initial values if they exist, or the previously hard coded values if not.
      * Changed: Non-softsynth non-GM drum tracks: Patch popups now show all drum AND melodic patches on ANY channel. (T356)
        - For drum tracks, if the song type is not GM, and the track's port is not a softsynth, then all patches
           including drum AND melodic are shown for ALL channels when 'select instrument patch' popup is clicked,
           regardless of the patches' 'drum' flag setting (in the instrument editor). 
           (Softsynths handle their own patch popup lists).
        - Added a 'bool isDrum' parameter to all populatePatchPopup() methods, which is passed 'true' only
           if it's a drum track, and changed a couple of lines in the only class which uses the drum flag - MidiInstrument.
        - Previous behaviour was to show drum patches ONLY on channel 10 of drum tracks. 
        - Reasons for change: 1): A midi device might have a non-standard drum channel(s), so drum patches 
           as well as melodic patches are shown for all channels. 2): Since any channel can be used in the drum map,
           melodic patches are shown as well as drum patches so that any patch can be selected for any channel.
          NOTE: Each of a drum track's channels which are used in the drum map should be set to a patch number, 
           otherwise it doesn't work right ! (**) This is true for softsynth devices too ! (**). 
          So it was imperative that the user be able to select ANY patch on ANY channel, to suit their setup, 
           for flexibility.
          (If that same flexibility were applied to regular midi tracks (non-drum tracks), it might make the
           'drum' flag for patches obsolete, since there would be no reason to filter them from the list !)
      * Changed: All midi controller event values sent to a midi port are now constrained (limited) to the port's
          instrument controller's range (if that instrument controller exists). (T356)
        - Example: Incoming events from a midi keyboard's pitch wheel range from -8192 to 8191, but it is
           desired to limit that range to, say -200 to 8191. One could use the midi input transformer to
           accomplish this, but instead now you can simply adjust the chosen instrument's pitch controller range
           (in the instrument editor), and then the pitch wheel's range will be limited to that range.
        - This only affects playback events (and therefore 'live' incoming events), but does NOT affect
           actual recorded data, so that by simply readjusting the instrument controller's range, 
           or by changing instruments, the range can be restored with no loss of recorded data range.
      * Fixed: Cleaned up all .idf files and changed ranges of all 'zero-bias' controls (-64/63 'pan' etc). (T356)
        - Many .idf files had bare '&' characters in them, causing corruption of names and values when reading.
        - Also turned on the 'drum' flag for ALL drum patches in MANY .idf instrument files.
          Some .idf's I was uncertain about, and did not change : AlesisQS6, Waldorf Q.
      * Changed: Fluidsynth pan controller range from 0/127 to -64/63. (T356)
        - To be consistent with .idf file changes.
      * Replaced: All direct calls to MidiPort::setHwCtrlState() from GUI thread, with new Audio::msgSetHwCtrlState(). (T356)
        - My fault, I was not paying attention to iter-thread communications.
      * Optimizations: Optimized MidiPort::setHwCtrlState(), MidiPort::sendEvent(), and calls to MidiPort::setCtrl(). (T356)
        - Optimized MidiPort::sendEvent().
        - Replaced code in MidiPort::setHwCtrlState() with more optimized code.
        - Replaced several clumsy calls to MidiPort::setCtrl(), which checked for and created the controller,
           with a new optimized MidiPort::setControllerVal(). 
06.01.2009
      * Fixed simpledrums/ssplugin.cpp to build with recent Ubuntu 8.10 (FN)
17.08.2008
      * Feature: Muse now has an instrument editor, complete with a midi controller editor! (T356)
        - Click on the menu "Midi->Edit Instrument".
        - You will see a sysex editor there too, but it is non-functional. (Use the midi event editor instead).
        - Tooltips and "What's This?" are provided with IMPORTANT information.
          If you want to understand how to use instruments, patches, and controllers in your song,
             READ THEM!    
      * Added: Environment variable MUSEINSTRUMENTS, so a (writable) instrument directory can be chosen
         instead of default /usr/share/muse/instruments etc. (T356)
        - Also added display of environment variables recognized by muse to command line help (muse -h).
      * Fixed: Popup displays of instrument patches to filter according to GM, GS, XG song type, and whether
         on drum channel 10. (T356)
        - Use the new instrument editor to set these GM, GS, XG, and drum filters.
      * Changed slightly: Creation of a new drum track - initialize to channel 10 instead of 1. (T356) 
      * Fixed: Force audio prefetch seek when play is pressed. (T356)
        - In Audio::seek, changed the call of audioPrefetch->msgSeek to force a prefetch,
           to ensure the most recent data. Things can happen to a part before play is pressed  
           such as part muting, part moving etc. Without a force, the wrong (old) data was being played.
        - If you perform those same operations while playing, there may be a few seconds delay before you
           hear the changes (the play cursor must move a certain distance before they're heard).
        - TODO: How to make the same thing happen when transport is externally started, such as from qjackctl.
            OR: How to force a prefetch at specific places like when a part is muted, and when it is moved,
                 instead of just before play is started. That way the operations can be done quickly while playing.
      * Fixed hangup: Upon loading of songs with fluidsynth soundfonts which can't be found. (T356)
        - (!) Removed error message box from FluidSynthGUI::processEvent causing freezeup.
        - You can still read fluidsynth errors by running muse on a command line. I figured it was 
           better to be able to load the song and to see errors, instead of just letting it freeze.
        - This should now allow you to share fluidsynth songs with other people (without the soundfonts).
      * Fixed: Audio aux tracks not working, intermittent. (T356)
        - Aux functionality was intermittent depending on whether the aux had out routes,
           and whether any tracks feeding the aux had out routes, and other factors.
        - In Audio::process1, rearranged, and added, some code to make aux work all the time now.   
      * Speedups: To some songChanged() functions. Ignore unnecessary flags. (T356)
        - For example simply adjusting midi gui controls would cause costly and
           unnecessary rebuilding/redrawing of certain areas, like parts of trackinfo, and controller graphs.
        - Noticeably less 'slugglish' when adjusting controls now.
      * Fixed: Midi controller events not being added to midi port controller, after record with no part. (T356)
        - Symptom: If you record midi controllers without first creating a part, muse creates the part 
           for you and creates the controller graph OK, but when you move the play cursor around, the graphs
           have no effect. This doesn't happen if you first create the part to record into, or manually edit a graph.
        - Symptom: As above, the graph is OK, but the controllers don't show up in the list when you click 'ctrl'.
        - Changed a line in song::cmdAddRecordedEvents() to use addEvent() instead of adding directly to list.
      * Fixed: Automatic detection of pitch bend wheel not working. (T356)
        - Added some code to MidiPort::sendEvent to detect ME_PITCHBEND events.
        - Note: There appears to be a sound system bug (using ALSA 1.0.15): The system will NOT deliver any pitch 
           bend events to muse until ANOTHER controller is detected, ex. move the modulation wheel THEN the pitch wheel.
          Verified with another app - RG - and with a real midi hardware to hardware connection (not my KB's fault).
      * Observed: Stuck or missing midi notes when recording or even just 'record armed only' 'live' playing. (T356)
        - The sound system appears to be having occasional trouble detecting midi events, including note-off ! 
          Verified with muse and RG (using ALSA 1.0.15). Not sure why or when this started, seems early this year...
      * Linked: All midi knobs and sliders with their labels. (T356)
        - Now they work together when displaying and adjusting.
        - After careful consideration of the meaning of 'off' in those
          labels, you now double click the label to turn the midi control on/off.
          Off does not mean 'zero'. Rather, it means:
          'Don't save this current value in the song file'.
          When a midi control is 'off', loading the song won't initialize the controller with a value.
          'Off' means the current value is set at 'unknown'. 'Unknown' means the actual 
           'behind the scenes' hardware value is the last value that was set. The knob or slider still 
           shows this value, or a default initial value, or if both of those are unknown, then 0.
      * Changed: Midi and audio level slider/knob labels to show '---' for infinite attenuation. (T356)
        - As mentioned above, the midi level slider labels can also show 'off'.
      * Fixed: The new midi controller knob in pianoroll and drum editor. (T356)
        - It was not adjusting anything.
      * Fixed: Midi vu meters again. Now they should work! (T356)
        - They were not responding to play events with an off velocity other than zero.
      * Fixed: Marker view window doesn't remember if it is open or closed. (T356)
        - Add a markerClosed function to app.
      * Reverted: Back to audioRTalloc in mpevent.h (T356)
        (!) - I had changed it to midiRTalloc, but that may have been causing problems like 
               midi shutdown (audio OK) after a few hours, and crash soon afterwards. 
              Verifying... No more midi shutdowns after a few hours, so far...
            Ooops, not so fast, happened again...
30.04.2008
      * Fixed bug in drum editor. Dragging the splitter too far left causes runaway resize, stuck in loop. (T356)
        - Tried several different arrangements, but QSplitter won't behave the way I need it to. Best I could do, so far. 
        - You may notice some strangeness, like the controller graph not aligning with the matrix, if the right edge 
           of the window is offscreen.
      * Added 'add/set event' to audio automation right-click popup menus. Ancient request by R.J. (T356)
      * Fixed arranger midi strip and arranger top controls not giving up keyboard focus after adjustment/entry. (T356)
        - Further request by user G.B. Changed all relevant QSpinBoxes to custom SpinBox, which behaves like this:
           Click up/down, or mousewheel, or hit enter with un-modified text (which means enter TWICE for modified text), 
            and the control will give up focus, thereby allowing you to use global shortcut keys afterwards. 
            Up/down keys still keep the focus.
        - TODO: Piano roll and drum editor.
      * Fixed major problem with lost jack routes upon file save, when save causes a jack shutdown. (T356)
        - Symptom: You click save, but jack shuts down during the save, causing lost jack routes in the file.
        - Fix: Cached the jack route names before file save, then used them during AudioTrack::writeRouting() xml code.
          Note this doesn't actually stop shutdowns from happening - now it just saves your files without losing jack routes.
      * Fixed mysterious intermittent wave part muting, as mentioned in 11.03.2008 (T356)
        - !!! PartList and EventList are now sorted by frame instead of tick, for wave parts only. Because fetchData() 
           didn't like sorting by ticks. This is a radical change. So far, no other areas found requiring further coding, but...
      * Overlapping wave parts and events now mix together, instead of one part or event taking priority over others ! (T356)
        - Virtually no speed hit, since muse was already cycling through all the wave parts/events, 
           just not mixing them together. So the very LAST wave part/event in the part/event lists was 
           taking priority over others.
      * Fixed default instrument midi controller min/max values. (T356)
        - Symptom: Some pianoroll midi controller graphs much too small or too big, vertically.
        - Cause: You added these controllers to your track as a midi instrument, ex. General Midi (GM), then you 
           changed the instrument, ex. to 'Generic Midi' or another instrument without those controllers,
           which set improper min/max values.
        - Fix: Added code to MidiPort::midiController() to set proper min/max values based on standard controller type.
          However, if the original instrument used CUSTOM min/max values, the graph may still be distorted.
      * Fixes to midi event list editor. (T356)
        - Added true sorting of event list. Now you can click on column headers to sort as desired! 
        - Added formatted program number display (like 1-1-120) for 'Val B' column.
        - Fixed Poly After Touch events display in list. They were being listed as Channel After Touch.
        - Fixed crash when 'Delete events' clicked with no actual items selected.
        - 'Edit Controller Event' dialog:
          - Fixed 'Create New Controller' popup list: Now it actually creates the selected controller.
          - Fixed 'Program' controller not showing correct program after selecting other controllers in list.
          - Fixed too high initial value displayed for controllers without an initial value in the instrument file.
        - 'Enter Poly After Touch' dialog:
          - Fixed uneditable note box. Switched from PitchLabel to PitchEdit. 
      * Feature added - Pianoroll and drum editor controller graphs now have a static manual adjustment knob ! (T356)
        - Now you don't have to enter controller graph values to adjust a setting, just turn the knob.
      * Changed 'Create New Controller' in event editor 'Edit Controller Event' dialog, and 'add new...' controller popup 
         list in piano roll. (T356)
        - Now they only list controllers not already added, instead of all of them. 
      * Fixed 'Position Edit' controls (0001.01.000 + up/down buttons) - click 'down' nothing happens. (T356)
        - Added updateButtons() call to PosEdit::setValue(). 
      * Fixed Mixer midi strip variation, reverb and chorus send knobs not enabled after controllers added. (T356)
        - Now you only need to create the controller to enable the knobs, allowing you to set a manual value without  
           having to actually create one or more controller events first.
      * Fixed midi trackinfo pan value not the same as midi mixer strip pan value. (T356)
        - Trackinfo pan now goes from 'off' (-65) to -64 to +63.
      * Fixes to fluidsynth. Would crash when getting patch names from an 'unspecified' soundfont. (T356)
        - In fluidsynti.cpp, various places check for FS_UNSPECIFIED_FONT only. Added check for FS_UNSPECIFIED_ID.
        - Not sure if FS_UNSPECIFIED_FONT is redundant and unnecessary, but left it there anyway.
      * Fixed old bug - IntLabel control - right click causes popup and runaway increment. (T356)
        - Fixed NEntry widget. Same fix as for double entry widget (DEntry), somewhere way down on this change log...
      * More fixes to wave part gluing/splitting/drawing/playing. (T356)
        - Now all splitting/gluing of wave parts, even overlapping ones, even multiple times, should work.
        - Fixed problem in WaveTrack::fetchData causing it to read too many samples of wave events.
      * Fixes and changes to bounce functions. (T356)
        - Fixed garbled target track or file. processWrite() was writing ALL the Audio Outputs to the file or track, instead of just one.
        - Feature: Bounce to track (from menu): You now first select any single Audio Output track, and any single target Wave track.
        - Feature: Bounce to file (from menu): You now first select any single Audio Output track.
      * Fixed some problems with Mastertrack window. (T356)
        - Mastertrack window was causing tempos to be inserted into tempo list, if window open when project loaded.
        - Added signature list change event handling - to update signature value box.
        - Fixed drawing of signature scale after signature list change.
      * Fixed wave editor 'reverse' function crashing. (T356)
      * Fixed track list not highlighting wave tracks (default green) when selected in the arranger window. (T356)
      * Fixed midi VU meters, again. (T356)
        - Borrowed idea from Muse 2. Self-decay the meters in midi strip code, rather than the midi thread code.
        - The midi VU meters self-decay at a rate determined by the GUI update rate in the configuration.
11.03.2008
      * Fixed arranger controls not giving up keyboard focus after adjustment/entry. Requested by user G.B. (T356)
      * Fixed gluing/splitting of waveparts. (Known bug of 02.02.2008 is gone now). (T356)
      * Fixed playing, and arranger/waveeditor drawing, of glued waveparts. (T356)
        - 'Working on' of 26.01.2008 is done.
        - Drawing of waveparts, even 'glued' ones, now fully respects tempo changes.
      * Fixed 'glued' mono + stereo wavepart drawing. Was drawing outside track if track height small. (T356)
      * Fixed soloed/muted wavetrack audio 'bleeding' into other wavetracks. fetchData() was not checking isMute(). (T356)
      * Fixed part colour popup to change unselected clicked item colour if no parts selected. (T356)
      * Fixed recent possible accidental(?) change of tracklist xml tag 'header' to 'header1'. (T356)
        - Muse was complaining: Tlist: unknown tag <header> at line 32
      * Fixed MREventList in mpevent.h, to use midiRTalloc instead of audioRTalloc. (T356)
        - Possible accidental(?) coding error since there is no other usage of midiRTalloc at all in muse.
        - If it does help at all, it might just ease RT congestion a bit.
      * Working on MIDI VU meters. They're too fast to see with jack, but should be OK with dummy driver. (T356)
      * KNOWN PREEXISTING BUGS
        - If you move waveparts around AFTER the current play position, then play, muse actually plays the same
           arrangement as if you had not moved the waveparts at all, just one time - rewind the play position and
           it corrects itself. This is because muse does not prefetch the audio again after the movement of the parts.
          Workaround - After moving waveparts, be sure to rewind the play position to a point AT LEAST before those parts.
        - Wave parts will sometimes mysteriously go silent for no reason. Move the parts slightly, or reload, or do
           certain other operations, then the sound comes back. Working on this important issue!  
02.02.2008
      * Fixed a slight error in BigTime absolute display. Now shows proper absolute tick and frame values. (T356)
      * Added an extra arranger wavepart right-click popup menu item - "file info". 
        Shows what wave file(s) are used by the wavepart event(s). 
        TODO: Either remove duplicate file names or list the files by event number. 
              Spice up with more info like wave starting/ending points etc.             (T356)
      * Removed some debug output lines from dummy driver - may have been causing intermittent crashes when moving position. (T356)
      * Some more fixes to arranger partcanvas wavepart drawing - speeded up and tightened code.
        KNOWN BUG: Does not correctly display more than one wave 'event' (file) per wavepart. (For ex. two waveparts 'glued' together).
                   Working on this issue ! (T356)
27.01.2008
      * Fixed MIDI mixer strip VU meters. Let there be light! Not the best solution, a choice between two so-so methods. 
        Looking at how to improve it... (T356)
26.01.2008
      * Pianoroll and drumedit now open at the current cursor position. (T356)
        (The cursor position is that moving black vertical line on the time scale). 
        This means you just click on an arranger midi part where you want to open the editor.
      * Arranger, pianoroll, drumedit and waveedit now stay at their current (left-side) position when you use the scale bar. (T356)
      * Fixed 'end of part' drawing problems - now you are guaranteed to see about 1+1/4 extra bar after the end 
         of a pianoroll/drumedit (also compensating for drumedit drummap/canvas splitter), allowing you to 
         add/move/clone notes past the end and allowing muse to properly auto-extend the part (to the right).  
        TODO: Auto-extend parts to the left when necessary. (T356)
      * Added vertical, and fixed horizontal, lasso/parts/events auto-scroll - even past the end of parts.  (T356)
      * Fixed drawing of wave parts in arranger. Now you can rely on the 'picture' of the wave inside the part 
         lining up correctly with the time scale, regardless of tempo/timesig changes in the song. (T356)
      * More fixes to wave editor. Fixed drawing of markers - they were much too close together.
        Added songChanged synchronization with arranger (you move/resize a wave part and the wave editor readjusts, etc.)
        WORKING ON: In the arranger, if you move a wave part to the left, the wave editor will readjust but the
         wave may be chopped off at the end. Investigating...  (T356)
      * Corrected the drawing order of items from ALL parts in pianoroll and drumedit. For multiple-part viewing.
        WORK IN PROGRESS: Added ability to select items from different parts at once, and to move them. 
                          For now, only items from the currently selected part actually move. (T356)
      * Added small checkbox to Big Time display. Now you can switch between formatted or absolute time display.
        Absolute is handy for syncing with another app, or just knowing, absolutely, where you are in the song. Absolutely.
        Added ToolTip popups describing each 'group' of numbers (bars, beats, ticks etc). (T356)
20.01.2008
      (ml)
      * Added function for deleting note overlaps in piano roll (usually makes fluidsynth grumpy - silencing the following note). 
      * Some work on opening the editor at current position and selecting the leftmost item
      (ws)
      * fixed hanging note when editing multiple parts in midieditor and
        switching part
19.01.2008 (ws)
      * fixed Song::changeEvent(): part tick offset was not used
      * fixed removing of controller events in Song::deleteEvent(); this affects midi recording
        in replace mode and controller editing
12.10
      * Fixed automation right-click popup menu 'prev/next event' not working after a tempo change. (T356)
        - Now you are guaranteed to be able to navigate the automation events, regardless
           of how many tempo or time signature changes are in the song, or if you change the tempo/sig(s)
           AFTER adding automation events.
12.06
      * Fixed softsynths 'Fluidsynth', 'Deicsonze', and 'Fluid' to allow pitch wheel changes. (T356)
      * Fixed softsynths 'Fluidsynth' and 'Deicsonze' to allow MIDI patch changes. (T356)
        Note that I included MIDI patch change code in 'Fluid', but fluid is slightly broken
         and still doesn't respond. 'Fluid' should be removed from muse. It's obsolete. Use Fluidsynth.
11.22
      * Fixed LASH loading and saving. (T356)
        - Symptom - Muse fails building with error about 'lash_get_fqn' not declared in scope.
        - Cause - You are building muse with LASH > 0.5.1, where certain header files have been removed.
        - Fix - Replaced both calls to lash_get_fqn with QString manipulations instead.
      * NOTE! I encountered a muse segfault when you use LASH to close the project.
        It says 'received unknown LASH event of type 10' (which is LASH_Server_Lost), then it says
         'received unknown LASH event of type <<some big random number>>, then segfault and
         a glibc backtrace due to 'double free or corruption'. Not a big deal, but this will need to be fixed.
      * Tested OK saving and loading projects with LASH 0.5.4

      * Fixed bug 1650953 - select and move segfault  (T356)
        - Symptom - In piano roll, select some notes and move them past the end of the part,
          then muse crashes. Also occurs when pasting or adding notes past part length.
        - Cause - Canvas was not adding the new resized part to the midi editor. Also a bunch
          of other stuff needed to be fixed for it all to work OK.
      * Fixed broken master list editor. Should also cure bug 1687166 (T356)
        - Symptom - Open master list and nothing is listed (should be at least one default
          tempo and one default time signature). Click to add new tempo or sig and muse crashes.
        - Cause - Some code was added to lmaster.cpp: LMaster::updateList() which broke it.
      * Added auto part resizing to drum canvas  (T356)
        - Symptom - In drums editor, there is no auto part resizing, like in piano roll.
        - Cause - Missing all part resizing code. Added.
      * Fixed intermittent crash when cutting a part. Improper 'delete while iterate' STL operation. (T356)
      * Fixed arranger part selection - selected parts now draw on top of non-selected parts. (T356)
      * Fixed arranger part operations (move etc.) to use selected part. (T356)
      * Fixed arranger keyboard left and right previous/next part selection. (T356)
        - Now you can use left/right arrow keys to cycle through parts in a track,
           especially useful for overlapping parts!
      * Regarding part selection - A remaining problem is that there is no 'z-order' drawing
         scheme. The part item list has no such ordering support.
        - This means a selected part will (now) appear on top of others, but when unselected,
           it will not stay on top. Adding that support could be messy.
        - Best to leave it alone for now. At least you can (now) cycle through overlapped parts...
      * Tested arranger part operations with worst case scenario - multiple tempo changes
         and multiple parts. Test OK. All should be OK now. (T356)
      * Added tooltip to song length box in arranger with text 'song length in bars'. (T356)
      * Fixed wave editor - Black selection bar intermittent drawing. (T356)
        - Symptom - In wave editor selecting a portion of the wave caused intermittent drawing
          of the black selection bar.
        - Cause - Unsure of exact cause or a permanent cure, but it's better now.
          But it still draws intermittently if you zoom in (x magnify) very very close.
          Working on this issue.
      * Added feature - Wave editor now allows you to open multiple selected wave parts and
         will display only those parts and you can edit them. Tested wave editor 'functions'
         menu and it works OK on some or all selected portions of the multiple wave parts.
        - This is in preparation for a possible automation viewer and/or editor.
        - Work in progress. Some rough parts still to clean up. (T356)
      * Fixed intermittent arithmetic exception crash in wave viewer. (T356)
      * Fixed bad wave drawing above certain zoom level in wave editor. (T356)
      * Enabled serial numbers in my deltaTick2Frame and deltaFrame2Tick routines, and
         merged code. Makes it a bit faster. (T356)
=======
08.16 * Reverted change in synth.cpp, realtime playback of softsynths did not work (rj)
      * fix for sustain pedal to work as suspected when looping. (rj)
      * Above involved adding "managed-controllers", whenever a controller is found
        time will tell if this is the right solution (rj)
02.13
      * Feature request: 1650957 space bar should start/stop playback fixed by
        adding this possibility, old style is possible with property setting in
  configuration. (rj)
02.09
      * Fixed bug 1645575 - Eraser tool causes segfault in drum editor (T356)
      * Added the project AUTHORS        (whooo are you... who who...) (T356)
01.27
      * Fixes to remove lots of warnings and potential errors in the code (WillyFoobar)
        (rj by proxy)
      * Fix for bug #1074808 "NRPN - still 128 values?" from Sebastian Gutsfeld (rj)
01.06
      * Changed 'exit' to 'return' when plugins are invalid (rj)

      =======================================

2007.01.03
      * Fixed some major issues with undo/redo. (T356)
        - Symptom - Delete track(s), then undo, muse crashes.
        - Symptom - Rename a track, then undo, muse crashes.
        - Cause - 'Delete' destroyed the track(s), so undo would attempt to restore
          non-existent object. Other problems caused rename crash. Still more undo/redo code
          was causing problems, like left-over synth instances hanging around after loading a new song,
          or crashing upon loading a new song if certain redo items were still in the redo list...
        - Known bugs - DON'T rename a synth track then undo, muse still crashes. Not sure why yet.
          After 'un-deleting' a synth track, you will have to open the 'MIDI Ports/Soft Synth' window
          and manually restore its MIDI port.
          Don't do anything too crazy like deleting multiple tracks while playing, might possibly crash.
          After undeleting an audio wave track, its sound might not be sync'd with the rest of the song -
          simply hit the fast-forward or rewind button to cure that.
      * Prevented saving, and segfault upon loading, of routes in med file with empty names. (T356)
        - Symptom - Jack shuts down, so instead of attempting to restart audio, you save your work,
          but when you try to reload your song, muse crashes.
        - Cause - Upon Jack shutdown, all audio in and out Jack routes were erased, and muse saved
          the song like that. Upon reload, muse would crash due to the empty routes in the .med file.
        - Note that this does not cure the original cause of this (Jack routes erased), so although you
          can now re-load the song without muse crashing, you must manually restore all the audio in/out
          Jack routes. So please try to restart the audio first. (Trying to fix this issue...)
      * Add new soloing system. Check it out! (T356)
        - Symptom - You click solo on a track but you hear nothing, and all other tracks are muted.
        - Cause - Wasn't really broken, you just had to solo all other tracks in that routing path
          to make sure whatever you were attempting to solo made its way to its destination so you
          would hear it.
          Inconvenient, yes. Especially with a large song with a lot of tracks, groups etc.
          With this new system, this is done automatically for you. Even MIDI tracks driving synth
          tracks, too.
        - Known bug - If a MIDI track drives some external MIDI device which you feed the audio
          back into muse, there's no way for muse to know how to couple the MIDI and audio in
          tracks together. Sorry you'll have to manually solo both.
          BUT - I'm CONSIDERING adding this - If an audio in track's name BEGINS WITH the name
          of a MIDI track, I could couple them that way. For example - MIDI track named 'Track1' and
          an audio in track named 'Track1 Input', then muse could mutually solo both tracks properly...
      * Enabled MIDI mixer strip solo buttons. (T356)
      * Some other minor fixups here and there. (T356)
        - Other known bugs - Due to an earlier oversight, if you use your own custom LADSPA plugin
          GUI's (see README.ladspaguis), QCheckbox and QCombobox controls may not automate quite right.
          Note that this includes just one built-in custom GUI - for the 'TAP Reverberator' plugin.
21.11
      * Fixed loading of .med files, with plugins, created before muse-0.9pre1. (t356)
        They will load, then save, correctly now.
        - Symptom - Load an old song with plugins and some of the plugin controls can't be moved.
        - Cause - Controller id's in med file mixed up, not save correctly, because of moving rack
          plugins around, which never properly switched the id's before muse-0.9pre1.
      * Fixed soloing (again). (t356)
        - Symptom - Delete a soloed track, then soloing is messed up - other tracks may be muted but don't show it,
          only way out is to reload. Speaking of which, loading also did not set track soloing correctly.
        - Cause - Upon deleting a track or loading a song, track solo ref count was not updated.
      * Added infrastructure for an improved soloing system, much more intuitive. (Not done yet!...) (t356)
      * Fixed spelling mistake - Freeverb "Rooom" size. (t356)
13.11
      * By T356
      * More automation fixes. Everything should be working now, check it out!
      * Although still no automation editor, all of these changes so far should help
         manipulate and navigate the events.
      * Fixed touch mode events storing, was not right.
      * Fixed a couple of stray signal connects which may have caused wacky controls.
      * Sliders, knobs and labels now respond to mousewheel and paging properly.
      * Linked slider/knob labels with sliders and knobs so paging or mousewheeling
         a label works smoothly and linearly, even with logarithmic controls.
      * Fixed integer controls (like Glame Bandpass 'stages').
      * Fixed external plugin gui's to look like the built-in freeverb. This means
         they now scale properly with different fonts. :)
      * Hopefully the last of major automation conceptual changes - making sliders, knobs,
         labels and checkboxes work together with the four automation modes, barring any fixes,
         and a few tweaks to follow (like shift key for label mousewheeling, and how to make
         a label stop updating so values can be entered). Some more right-click menu options
         may follow (like store event, enable automation, enable interpolation).
         Automation readme to come (need it!).
      * Still to fix - Controls' right-click automation menu still a bit confused upon tempo changes.
10.11
      * reworked mute, old solution caused problems for solo
      * solo is now united between midi and audio, they were previously
        interdependant. This has the downside that if a soft synth is
        soloed both the midi and the audio needs to have solo enabled (rj)
      * fixed issue with hanging notes for softsynths when stop is pressed (rj)
      * Backported fix from HEAD for using a file descriptor from two different
        threads, should make it work somewhat better with SMP (rj)
      * fixed faulty off value for aux when set to max (rj)
      * Allow wheeling of tracks from track list (rj)
08.11
      * re-enabled mute for outputs (rj)
07.11
      * Fixed timing bug causing MusE to depend on jack buffer setting
        this needs testing, it involved uncommenting some code that might
        have been commented for a reason (rj)
05.11
      * Added support for auto-scroll for other drag operations but
      rubberband (rj)
04.11
      =======================================
      * 0.9pre1 tagged (rj)
      =======================================
04.11
      * Adopted RT locking method from 1.0 branch. (rj)
      * Preparations for 0.9pre1 (rj)
31.10
      * By T356
      * Fixed old bug - DoubleLabel right click causes popup and runaway increment.
      * Currently the increment/decrement is fixed at 1, so that's why it doesn't
         work for pan or other controls with 1.0 or less max.
        - So fixes to that are next...
29.10
      * By T356
      * Changing global tempo now updates things. (Like resizing wave tracks).
      * Fixed segfault upon lengthening a blank new wave track part.
      * Removed some thread-unsafe code from my first patch
      * Fixed ladspa plugin automation not working until plugin displayed.
      * Improved automation and ladspa plugin automation behaviour.
        - While stopped and in touch mode, clicking an automateable control immediately
           writes the value to the list, so you don't have to press play then stop
           just to store one value.
        - Smoother slider transitions from last touched value to previous stored values,
           so that they don't suddenly 'jump' to previous stored values when you let go.
        - Checkboxes now automated. Their behaviour in touch mode is slightly
           different than sliders - they remain 'touched' until you stop, but store
           only up to the last toggle done.
        - Checkboxes now check as soon as you click them.
        - Sliders now have 'mouse cursor capture (tm)' so you can actually grab onto
           the thumbs even if they are moving too quickly due to automation. Paging can
           still be done with right button.
        - Sliders and knobs now work properly if you 'page' them (click outside the thumb
           or dial).
        - Added right-click popup menu on all automateable controls with
            previous event    (seek)
            next event        (seek)
            erase event       (if cursor is on one)
            erase range       (between left and right markers)
            clear automation  (clear all events)
          Known bug: Becomes slightly confused if tempo is changed after doing automation.
          Workaround for now: Press play to update the cursor to a new position.
04.10
      * Select the right item when items are stacked on top of each other, for pianoroll
        and arranger (rj)
      * Do not display resize cursor when last track cannot be resized (rj)
03.10
      * Apply effect rack before sending aux, changed after discussion with Thorsten Wilms (rj)
      * Auto assign internal softsynths upon creation (rj)
      * New method for pasting parts. If several parts are pasted they are now spaced
        according to their original spacing. This only works reliably when the copied parts
        are all on one track. (Possibly copying parts from several tracks should be
        disallowed), fixes bug #1516294 (rj)
      * Muting of midi-tracks no longer mute input, bug #1092343 (rj)
01.10
      * Fixed issue with playing of controllers when moving playhead. basically
        all events from all parts where played at the beginning, fixes bug #1316542 (rj)
30.09
      * Cached peak files are now updated when wave files are more recent, bug #1469177(rj)
      * Fixed bug with recording notes to existing part, bug #1552783 (rj)
29.09
      * MusE now asks when imported wave file has differing samplerate, bug #1428248 (rj)
28.09
      * Always restore sequencer configuration even when song
        is loaded without config, fixes bug #1092289, midi mixer settings not restored (rj)
27.09
      * Optimizations and fixes to rubberband scrolling (rj)
      * Aux changed to be affected by volume and pan (rj)
      * Aux now affected by mute (rj)
26.09
      * Fix for pianoroll selection of events in/outside loop with respect to part offset (ml)
      * Added lasso/rubberband scrolling in arranger, drumedit and pianoroll, bug #1057732 (rj)
24.09
      * Followups by T356
      * Fixed rack plugin change not clearing automation
      * Fixed moving an empty rack position
      * Fixed moving a plugin onto itself

         strip names to match icon colours
20.09
      * Fixed aux sending (rj)
      * Patch from terminator356 to fix logarithmic feedback to plugin sliders (rj)
19.09
      * Various fixes from Torsten Duwe (rj)
        - deicsonze undefined returnvalue
        - vam uninitialized value
        - 64bit fix for calling external wave editor
      * Fixed multiple part undo for move,drag and copy in arranger, bug #1516298 (rj)
      * Fixed multiple note undo for move and drag in pianoroll (rj)
      * Fixed cursor placement in List Editor upon deleting events bug #1417718 (rj)
16.09
      * Following changes by   { terminator356 [at] users [dot] sourceforge [dot] net }
      * The changes can be applied to muse-0.7.2preX or muse-0.8.1 and work fine in both.
      * Fixed soloing. Also multiple soloing now allowed.
        - TODO: Soloing of tracks which feed a group. Workaround for now: Solo the tracks AND the group.
      * Enabled solo buttons on the mixer strips.
      * Fixed major issues with rack plugin moving, saving and loading.
      * Fixed problems with multiple tempo changes and incorrect wave part lengths.
      * Changed plugin code to use double instead of float to stop certain errors, and consistency.
      * Fixed some minor spelling mistakes.
      * Fixed issues with audio track automation.
      * Fixed very 'jumpy' volume sliders and pan knobs under automation.
      * Fixed several other small problems. For example a duplicate define in song.h
      * Changed the way audio track automation works.
        - For ease of use, the current mode now remains selected, even after a file write and re-open.
        - To reduce the chance of accidental changes, for added visual warning, Touch and Write modes
           colour the automation mode box red.
        - Write and Touch modes: Only if the controls were touched, changes will be stored when
           the transport is stopped. Since the current mode remains active, you can move to
           another part and do some more automation.
        - Write mode: The controls are updated with stored values until you touch them, then they
           store from the time you hit play to the time you hit stop. If you touch the controls AFTER
           you hit play, you may get unexpected results so remember to initialize that 'first value'
           (at the time when you hit play), since muse will NOT 'fill in' from the time you hit play
           to the time you first touched the control, with the value of that first touch. (Maybe support
           this later).
        - If you load a plugin preset, if the control values don't seem correct, try setting the track's
           automation to 'Off', because the track will usually be on 'Read' - reading stored values.
        - TODO: Muse really needs an automation editor/viewer! Perhaps integrate with wave viewer.
                Also, add one more automation mode: 'Instant mode'.
      * Hmmm, oh yes - added full LADSPA plugin automation. Check it out!
        Compatibility with existing med files' Plugin section should be OK, but if you open an
         existing med file with plugins, and the plugins' control values are no longer correct,
         let me know. See comments (with these changes applied) audiotrack.cpp around line 557.
        - TODO: Checkbox automation not working right. We need a better checkbox - one which checks
                 as soon as you press down! Also would like to add bypass and mute automation.

             The GUI is startet as a separate process connected
             to the midi instrument. The gui sends midi commands
             (sysex) to stdout. This midi data stream is connected
             to the midi instrument port.

            - play
      - fixed: graphic master editor: missing display refresh
        after signature change
      - changed midiThruFlag: removed from Config->MidiPorts;
        "midi thru" now is associated with a track, if set all input
        to that track is echoet to track port/channel

0.4.5:
      MESSS: (MusE Experimental Software Synthesizer interface Spec):
        A software synthesizer is implemented as a dynamic
        loadable library (*.so file) with two interfaces to the
        outside world:

            - a LADSPA interface for audio output
            - a midi sequencer interface registered to ALSA

      MusE searches all available synths and presents a list
      in Config->SoftSynthesizer. To use a synthesizer you have
      to create an instance. Several instances of an synt can be
      created and used. Every instance creates

        a) an alsa midi sequencer port (look at Config->MidiPorts)
        b) a new strip in the audio mixer

      As a demo i ported a stripped down version of the iiwu
      software synthesizer (http://www.iiwu.org) to MusE.
      Setup info is in README.softsynth
