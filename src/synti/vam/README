VAM: Virtual Analog for MusE

*** WARNING! VAM has at the time some significant problems

*** env mod or dco sustain )

* What's VAM??

    VAM is a soft synth for MusE (http://muse.seh.de) emulating
    an old monophonic two oscillator analog synthesizer. It has
    a simple interface and a quite fast synthesis engine.

* Installation
    MusE version >= 0.5.0 required (I think)
    ( and everything that MusE requires, like Qt3 )

    Unpack VAM in $MUSESOURCEDIR/synthi and run from vam/ make;
    make install. VAM won't compile automatically if you run make 
    from $MUSESOURCEDIR.
    $MUSESOURCEDIR is the directory you have the MusE source.
    For optimizing add -march=(your arch) to the compiler arguments
    in Makefile.

* Using VAM:

    To have fun with VAM MusE really should be started with -R.
    Otherwise VAM will produce mostly noise, like clicks.
    If you're familiar with analog or virtual analog synthesizers
    using VAM shouldn't be a problem.

    If you add some cool LADSPA plugins like delay or chorus to VAM's
    output, you'll get _much_ better sounds, playing without effects
    is like eating beef without sauce.
