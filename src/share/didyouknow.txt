To get started with MusE why don't you visit the <br>

MusE can add effects in realtime for audio tracks,<br>
check the effect rack on the mixer strip

For routing and selection dialogs that allow multiple selections<br>
use ctrl when clicking to keep the dialog open

If you regularly make the same type of connections you can make a<br>
template-project with all of your basic settings already prewired.<br>
Just store the song as a template using the project dialog.

It's possible to create midi filters or generators in any<br>
language, see instructions and examples under <br>
src/share/scripts in the source.

Click on the automation column in the track list to make<br>
automation lines visible for a specific parameter.

Adding effects will add more automatable parameters to the<br>
automation column.

Most functions in MusE are reachable from the keyboard.<br>
See 'Keyboard Shortcuts...' under 'Settings'.<br>
For instance: A - pointer, D - draw, R - erase, S - cut.<br>
A full list of all shortcuts, formatted for printing (sort of)<br>
is available from the Shortcut dialog.

Midi parts can be cloned. All clone parts contain the same data,<br>
change one and all will be changed.

Parts can be copied and deleted using the standard cut/copy/paste<br>
but it is also possible to click and drag parts to duplicate.<br>
ctrl+click+drag to duplicate parts<br>
ctrl+alt+click+drag to create clones

If it's hard to be precise while moving automation points with the mouse,<br>
trying holding the SHIFT key, the movement will be slower.

During recording it is often useful to restart the recording since the previous<br>
take wasn't perfect or you simply want several takes. While recording press<br>
shift+space (default shortcut), a new track is created and the recording is<br>
restarted from the initial position.<br>
If recording was done on multiple tracks, all the armed tracks will be duplicated.

MusE 4.x defaults to connecting to Pulse Audio instead of Jack to ease startup<br>
for new users. To connect to Jack change the default sound output on the<br>
Audio configuration tab in Global Settings.<br>
Or use the command line overrides to start the specific driver you wish to use.
